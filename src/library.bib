abstract = {Hyporheic flow in streams has typically been studied separately from geomorphic processes. We investigated interactions between bed mobility and dynamic hyporheic storage of solutes and fine particles in a sand-bed stream before, during, and after a flood. A conservatively transported solute tracer (bromide) and a fine particles tracer (5m latex particles), a surrogate for fine particulate organic matter, were co-injected during base flow. The tracers were differentially stored, with fine particles penetrating more shallowly in hyporheic flow and retained more efficiently due to the high rate of particle filtration in bed sediment compared to solute. Tracer injections lasted 3.5h after which we released a small flood from an upstream dam one hour later. Due to shallower storage in the bed, fine particles were rapidly entrained during the rising limb of the flood hydrograph. Rather than being flushed by the flood, we observed that solutes were stored longer due to expansion of hyporheic flow paths beneath the temporarily enlarged bedforms. Three important timescales determined the fate of solutes and fine particles: (1) flood duration, (2) relaxation time of flood-enlarged bedforms back to base flow dimensions, and (3) resulting adjustments and lag times of hyporheic flow. Recurrent transitions between these timescales explain why we observed a peak accumulation of natural particulate organic matter between 2 and 4cm deep in the bed, i.e., below the scour layer of mobile bedforms but above the maximum depth of particle filtration in hyporheic flow paths. Thus, physical interactions between bed mobility and hyporheic transport influence how organic matter is stored in the bed and how long it is retained, which affects decomposition rate and metabolism of this southeastern Coastal Plain stream. In summary we found that dynamic interactions between hyporheic flow, bed mobility, and flow variation had strong but differential influences on base flow retention and flood mobilization of solutes and fine particulates. These hydrogeomorphic relationships have implications for microbial respiration of organic matter, carbon and nutrient cycling, and fate of contaminants in streams. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {The objective of this paper was to evaluate the accuracy of two advanced blending algorithms, Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) and Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (ESTARFM) to downscale Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) indices to the spatial resolution of Landsat. We tested two approaches: (i) "Index-then-Blend" (IB); and (ii) "Blend-then-Index" (BI) when simulating nine indices, which are widely used for vegetation studies, environmental moisture assessment and standing water identification. Landsat-like indices, generated using both IB and BI, were simulated on 45 dates in total from three sites. The outputs were then compared with indices calculated from observed Landsat data and pixel-to-pixel accuracy of each simulation was assessed by calculating the: (i) bias; (ii) R2; and (iii) Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD). The IB approach produced higher accuracies than the BI approach for both blending algorithms for all nine indices at all three sites. We also found that the relative performance of the STARFM and ESTARFM algorithms depended on the spatial and temporal variances of the Landsat-MODIS input indices. Our study suggests that the IB approach should be implemented for blending of environmental indices, as it was: (i) less computationally expensive due to blending single indices rather than multiple bands; (ii) more accurate due to less error propagation; and (iii) less sensitive to the choice of algorithm.},

We provide a basic method for quantifying nutrient limitation of stream biofilms using nutrient diffusing substrata. We also detail two advanced methods that can be used to quantify nutrient spiraling within streams using experimental addition approaches: a short-term nutrient release and a15N stable isotope tracer addition. Finally, we describe several modifications to the various methods that could expand their application to various research questions or to allow for customization depending on specific research questions. Understanding the nutrient limitation status and quantifying nutrient uptake in streams is vital because these are key components of ecosystem function, providing information on how streams retain nutrients from watersheds prior to downstream export.},

abstract = {Stream metabolism is a fundamental, integrative indicator of aquatic ecosystem functioning. However, it is not well understood how heterogeneity in physical channel form, particularly in relation to and caused by in‐stream woody debris, regulates stream metabolism in lowland streams. We combined conservative and reactive stream tracers to investigate relationships between patterns in stream channel morphology and hydrological transport (form) and metabolic processes as characterized by ecosystem respiration (function) in a forested lowland stream at baseflow. Stream reach‐scale ecosystem respiration was related to locations (“hotspots”) with a high abundance of woody debris. In contrast, nearly all other measured hydrological and geomorphic variables previously documented or hypothesized to influence stream metabolism did not significantly explain ecosystem respiration. Our results suggest the existence of key differences in physical controls on ecosystem respiration between lowland stream systems (this study) and smaller upland streams (most previous studies) under baseflow conditions. As such, these findings have implications for reactive transport models that predict biogeochemical transformation rates from hydraulic transport parameters, for upscaling frameworks that represent biological stream processes at larger network scales, and for the effective management and restoration of aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {Understanding interactions between nutrient cycles is essential for recognizing and remediating human impacts on water quality, yet multielemental approaches to studying nutrient cycling in streams are currently rare. Here we utilized a relatively new approach (tracer additions for spiraling curve characterization) to examine uptake dynamics for three essential nutrients across a landscape that varied in absolute and relative nutrient availability. We measured nutrient uptake for soluble reactive phosphorous, ammonium-nitrogen, and nitrate-nitrogen in 16 headwater streams in the Catskill Mountains, New York. Across the landscape, ammonium-nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus had shorter uptake lengths and higher uptake velocities than nitrate-nitrogen. Ammonium-nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus uptake velocities were tightly correlated, and the slope of the relationship did not differ from one, suggesting strong demand for both nutrients despite the high ambient water column dissolved inorganic nitrogen: soluble reactive phosphorus ratios. Ammonium-nitrogen appeared to be the preferred form of nitrogen despite much higher nitrate-nitrogen concentrations. The uptake rate of nitrate-nitrogen was positively correlated with ambient soluble reactive phosphorus concentration and soluble reactive phosphorus areal uptake rate, suggesting that higher soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations alleviate phosphorus limitation and facilitate nitrate-nitrogen uptake. In addition, these streams retained a large proportion of soluble reactive phosphorus, ammonium-nitrogen, and nitrate-nitrogen supplied by the watershed, demonstrating that these streams are important landscape filters for nutrients. Together, these results (1) indicated phosphorus limitation across the landscape but similarly high demand for ammonium-nitrogen and (2) suggested that nitrate-nitrogen uptake was influenced by variability in soluble reactive phosphorus availability and preference for ammonium-nitrogen.},

abstract = {Abstract Subsurface flow dominates water movement from hillslopes to streams in most forested headwater catchments. Hewlett and Hibbert (1963) constructed an idealized hillslope model (0.91 ? 0.91 ? 15.0 m; 21.8°) using reconstituted C horizon soil to investigate importance of interflow, a type of subsurface flow. They saturated the model, covered it to prevent evaporation, and allowed free drainage for 145 d. The resulting recession drainage curve suggested two phases: fast drainage of saturated soil in the first 1.5 d, then slow drainage of unsaturated soil. Hydrologists interpreted the latter as evidence interflow could sustain baseflow, even during extended drought. Since that experiment, typical forest vegetation grew in the model, providing root and litter inputs for 55 years. We removed all above-ground live biomass and repeated the experiment physically and numerically (HYDRUS-2D), hypothesizing that pedogenesis would change the drainage curve and further elucidate the role of unsaturated flow from hillslopes. Contrary to this hypothesis, drainage curves in our twice-repeated physical experiments and numerical simulation were unchanged for the first {\~{}}10 days, indicating pedogenesis and biological processes had not largely altered bulk hydraulic conductivities or soil moisture release characteristics. However, drainage unexpectedly ceased after about two weeks (14.3 ± 2.52 d), an order of magnitude sooner than in the original experiment, due to an apparent leak in the hillslope analogous to commonly observed bedrock fractures in natural systems. Thus, our results are a more natural recession behavior that highlights how incorporation of alternative hydrologic outputs can reduce drainage duration and volume from soils to baseflow.},

abstract = {Observation of surface water is a functional requirement for studying ecological and hydrological processes. Recent advances in satellite-based optical remote sensors have promoted the field of sensing surface water to a new era. This paper reviews the current status of detecting, extracting, and monitoring surface water using optical remote sensing, especially progress in the last decade. It also discusses the current status and challenges in this field, including spatio-temporal scale issues, integration with in situ hydrological data and elevation data, obscuration caused by clouds and vegetation, and the growing need to map surface water at a global scale. Historically, sensors have exhibited a contradiction in resolutions. Techniques including pixel unmixing and reconstruction, and spatio-temporal fusion have been developed to alleviate this contradiction. Spatio-temporal dynamics of surface water have been modeled by combining remote sensing data with in situ river flow. Recent studies have also demonstrated that the river discharge can be estimated using only optical remote sensing imagery, providing valuable information for hydrological studies in ungauged areas. Another historical issue for optical sensors has been obscuration by clouds and vegetation. An effective approach of reducing this limitation is to combine with synthetic aperture radar data. Digital elevation model data have also been employed to eliminate cloud/terrain shadows. The development of big data and cloud computation techniques makes the increasing demand of monitoring global water dynamics at high resolutions easier to achieve. An integrated use of multisource data is the future direction for improved global and regional water monitoring. Plain Language Summary Observing surface water is essential for ecological and hydrological studies. This paper reviews the current status of detecting, extracting, and monitoring surface water using optical remote sensing, especially progress in the last decade. It also discusses the current status and challenges in this field. For example, it was found that pixel unmixing and reconstruction, and spatio-temporal fusion are two common and low-cost approaches to enhance surface water monitoring. Remote sensing data have been integrated with in situ river flow to model spatio-temporal dynamics of surface water. Recent studies have also proved that the river discharge can be estimated using only optical remote sensing imagery. This will be a breakthrough for hydrological studies in ungauged areas. Optical sensors are also easily obscured by clouds and vegetation. This limitation can be reduced by integrating optical data with synthetic aperture radar data and digital elevation model data. There is increasing demand of monitoring global water dynamics at high resolutions. It is now easy to achieve with the development of big data and cloud computation techniques. Enhanced global or regional water monitoring in the future requires integrated use of multiple sources of remote sensing data.},

abstract = {Stream ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling may vary with stream position in the network. Using a scaling approach, we examined the relationship between stream size and nutrient uptake length, which represents the mean distance that a dissolved solute travels prior to removal from the water column. Ammonium (NH4+) uptake length increased proportionally with stream size measured as specific discharge (discharge/stream width) with a scaling exponent Combining double low line 1.01. In contrast, uptake lengths for nitrate (NO3{\&}minus;) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) increased more rapidly than increases in specific discharge (scaling exponents Combining double low line 1.19 for NO3{\&}minus; and 1.35 for SRP). Additionally, the ratio of inorganic nitrogen (N) uptake length to SRP uptake length declined with stream size; there was relatively lower demand for SRP compared to N as stream size increased. Finally, we related the scaling of uptake length with specific discharge to that of stream length using Hack's law and downstream hydraulic geometry. Ammonium uptake length increased less than proportionally with distance from the headwaters, suggesting a strong role for larger streams and rivers in regulating nutrient transport. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

abstract = {Assessments of biotic nutrient limitation in aquatic ecosystems typically rely on concentrations and ratios of potentially limiting nutrients. While successful in lakes, this approach has been less effective in streams, which often are dominated by benthic autotrophs (e.g., algae and vascular plants). We compared water-column nutrient concentration (C) to 3 alternative metrics and assessed their ability to predict autotrophic nutrient limitation in streams. One metric, nutrient flux (F) is the product of nutrient concentration and stream discharge. The other 2 metrics, autotrophic uptake length (Sw,a) and autotrophic uptake velocity (Vf,a), are derived from nutrient-spiraling theory and incorporate nutrient uptake. To evaluate the ability of each metric to predict nutrient limitation, we analyzed nutrient diffusing substrata (NDS) data from the Lotic Intersite Nitrogen eXperiment (LINX) (phases I and II; n = 80 streams across North America). We calculated NDS response ratios (RRs) to quantify the strength of autotrophic nutrient limitation in each stream, and we regressed RRs against each of the 4 metrics for N and P. For the LINX I analysis, Sw,a was the best predictor of autotrophic N limitation. F and Vf,a also performed well, and C was a poor predictor. In contrast, all 4 metrics were poor predictors of N limitation for the LINX II analysis when evaluated for individual streams, by land use, and within regions. None of the metrics were able to predict P limitation for either LINX study. Accuracy could be enhanced by developing new methods to quantify autotrophic nutrient uptake and limitation in stream reaches, but consistency with nutrient-spiraling theory and improved predictability of autotrophic N limitation make Sw,a a potentially useful metric for evaluating N limitation in streams. {\textcopyright} 2014 by The Society for Freshwater Science.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic activities have led to increased transfers of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to surface waters where changes in the absolute amounts of N and P delivery, and in N:P ratios, threaten water quality. While models of riverine fluxes are increasingly good at predicting total annual nutrient loads, our understanding of which features of a watershed differentially affect N and P transport downstream is still limited. In this study, we used linear mixed models to quantify the relative transport of N and P through different landscape and limnoscape compartments (e.g. hill slopes, lakes, reservoirs,) under a variety of climate regimes over 26 years in 18 watersheds of the St. Lawrence Basin. Water retention capacity and precipitation patterns were the features that most strongly influenced nutrient export from land to water, where P was preferentially retained in the landscape over N when water retention capacity was highest. Lakes and reservoirs also emerged as features that influenced nutrient fluxes, where lakes preferentially retain more P over N and reservoirs tended to export N. Factors that favor erosion, such as flashiness of precipitation and land-use change also alter N:P ratios in receiving waters, largely by mobilizing legacy sources of P.},

abstract = {Stoichiometric analyses can be used to investigate the linkages between N and C cycles and how these linkages influence biogeochemistry at many scales, from components of individual ecosystems up to the biosphere. N-specific NH 4+ uptake rates were measured in eight streams using short-term 15N tracer additions, and C to N ratios (C:N) were determined from living and non-living organic matter collected from ten streams. These data were also compared to previously published data compiled from studies of lakes, ponds, wetlands, forests, and tundra. There was a significant negative relationship between C:N and N-specific uptake rate; C:N could account for 41{\%} of the variance in N-specific uptake rate across all streams, and the relationship held in five of eight streams. Most of the variation in N-specific uptake rate was contributed by detrital and primary producer compartments with large values of C:N and small values for N-specific uptake rate. In streams, particulate materials are not as likely to move downstream as dissolved N, so if N is cycling in a particulate compartment, N retention is likely to be greater. Together, these data suggest that N retention may depend in part on C:N of living and non-living organic matter in streams. Factors that alter C:N of stream ecosystem compartments, such as removal of riparian vegetation or N fertilization, may influence the amount of retention attributed to these ecosystem compartments by causing shifts in stoichiometry. Our analysis suggests that C:N of ecosystem compartments can be used to link N-cycling models across streams. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

In each season, we used separate instantaneous pulse additions to quantify nutrient uptake rates and saturation kinetics of N (nitrate) and P (phosphate).

abstract = {The production of organic carbon by aquatic photosynthesis is a central ecosystem property that influences food webs and nutrient cycling rates. Although it is well known that several factors are related to variation in gross primary production in rivers, it is not known how these factors combine to determine primary productivity at the scale of river networks. Our simulation of river networks at a range of productivity regimes provides an initial approximation of river ecosystem productivity at broad scales, and shows that in some cases, small streams and certain time periods disproportionately influence river network productivity. Abstract High-resolution data are improving our ability to resolve temporal patterns and controls on river productivity, but we still know little about the emergent patterns of primary production at river-network scales. Here, we estimate daily and annual river-network gross primary production (GPP) by applying characteristic temporal patterns of GPP (i.e., regimes) representing distinct river functional types to simulated river networks. A defined envelope of possible productivity regimes emerges at the network-scale, but the amount and timing of network GPP can vary widely within this range depending on watershed size, productivity in larger rivers, and reach-scale variation in light within headwater streams. Larger rivers become more influential on network-scale GPP as watershed size increases, but small streams with relatively low productivity disproportionately influence network GPP due to their large collective surface area. Our initial predictions of network-scale productivity provide mechanistic understanding of the factors that shape aquatic ecosystem function at broad scales.},

abstract = {We investigated changes in respiration across nighttime and daytime in a headwater stream. For this, we conducted consecutive nighttime and daytime experiments injecting the bioreactive tracer resazurin in two reaches with different riparian canopy densities (different levels of photosynthetically active radiation) to compare respiration rate coefficients. We found that even though stream water temperatures measured above the streambed at day and night (half-day timescale) were different within each reach and across reaches (95{\%} confidence level), apparent respiration rate coefficients were not different across nighttime and daytime conditions (95{\%} confidence level). A likely explanation for this is that the bulk of stream respiration takes place in the hyporheic zone, where diel fluctuations of stream temperature and photosynthetically active radiation are considerably attenuated and where temperature is not measured in routine investigations of stream metabolism. Our results suggest that community respiration in headwater streams may not need to be ‘corrected' for temperature between daytime and nighttime, even though instantaneous changes in respiration are expected to occur from a pure biological perspective.

abstract = {We used End-Member Mixing Analysis (EMMA) to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of source water contributions to streamflow generation from three headwater catchments that span a precipitation and ecosystem type gradient across ∼1500 m elevation in the Colorado Front Range, USA. We additionally characterized the magnitude and type (rain versus snow) of precipitation and the resulting hydrologic response of surface and subsurface waters to this precipitation variability. The three catchments were representative of the montane rain-snow transition zone (snow was 39{\%} of total precipitation; $\sigma$ (standard deviation) = 10{\%}), the subalpine zone (69{\%} snow; $\sigma$ = 5{\%}), and the alpine zone (84{\%} snow; $\sigma$ = 10{\%}). All three catchments were identified as three end-member systems with their respective source waters being groundwater, snow precipitation or melt, rain (montane and subalpine only), and subsurface water from talus slopes (alpine only). Mean annual groundwater contributions were greater in forested catchments (28{\%}; $\sigma$ = 6{\%} in the montane, 31{\%}; $\sigma$ = 8{\%} in the subalpine) than in the alpine (19{\%}; $\sigma$ = 5{\%}) catchment. Snow-derived water contributions to streamflow were inversely related to groundwater and increased with elevation from 46{\%} ($\sigma$ = 15{\%}) in the montane zone to 58{\%} ($\sigma$ = 12{\%}) in the subalpine and 61{\%} ($\sigma$ = 7{\%}) in the alpine. Rain was 27{\%} ($\sigma$ = 8{\%}) of discharge in the montane and 11{\%} ($\sigma$ = 4{\%}) in the subalpine, while talus waters made up the final 21{\%} ($\sigma$ = 12{\%}) of streamflow in the alpine. Our results suggest that subsurface source waters (i.e. groundwater and talus water) that are influenced by the timing, magnitude, and type of recharge and by the storage capabilities of the subsurface may be the most sensitive to climate variability at higher elevations. In contrast, the proportion of rain versus snow was the primary control on source water variability at lower elevations.},

abstract = {Hydrological controls on DOC and N transport at the catchment scale were studied for five storm events from the fall of 2004 through the spring of 2005 in WS10, H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon. This catchment is devoid of any riparian zone and characterized by hillslopes that issue directly into the stream. This enabled us to compare a trenched hillslope response to the stream response without the influence of riparian zone mixing. DOC and N concentrations and dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality (specific UV-absorbance (SUVA) and C:N of DOM) were investigated at the plot scale, in lateral subsurface flow from the trenched hillslope and stream water at the catchment outlet at the annual and seasonal scale (transition vs. wet period) during baseflow and stormflow conditions. DON was the dominant form of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in all sampled solutions, except in transient groundwater, where DIN was the dominant form. Organic horizon leachate and transient groundwater were characterized by high SUVA, and high DOC and total N concentrations, while SUVA and DOC and DON concentrations in lysimeters decreased with depth in the soil profile. This suggests vertical preferential flow without much soil matrix interaction occurred at the site. Deep groundwater (from a spring at the base of the hillslope) was characterized by low SUVA and low DOC and N concentrations. SUVA was always lower in lateral subsurface flow than in stream water at the seasonal scale, even during the wet period when other solutes were similar between lateral subsurface flow and stream water. This suggested mixing of deep groundwater and shallow transient groundwater was different at the hillslope scale compared to the catchment scale. DOC and DON sources were finite (production of DOC and DON from the hillslope soils appeared to be limited) at the seasonal scale since DOC and DON concentrations were significantly lower during the wet period compared to the transition period during stormflow conditions. This was also reflected in the DOC and DON peak and flow weighted storm event concentrations and antecedent soil moisture relationship where drier conditions (less prior flushing) resulted in the highest DOC and DON peak and flow weighted storm event concentrations. Results from this study showed the importance of the hillslope component in DOC and N transport at the catchment scale and underscore the importance of sampling solutes below the root zone (transient groundwater) and the value of using SUVA to fingerprint DOC sources. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {1. Stream ecosystem metabolism integrates production and respiration of organic matter and plays a fundamental role in the global carbon (C) cycle. Several studies have identified distal and proximal physical controls, for example, land use and transient storage, or the effects of water chemistry, that is, organic matter and nutrient availability, on stream metabolism. In parallel, research on organic matter quality has identified conspicuous gradients of chemical composition, yet mostly without demonstrating any functional implications. 2. We hypothesise that organic matter holds a key position in a more comprehensive causal framework of stream ecosystem metabolism, and that a concurrent study can improve mechanistic understanding. Specifically, we here postulate that dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality, that is, its chemical composition, acts as a control of ecosystem respiration (ER) as much as it is a result of gross primary production (GPP). As such, DOM quality likely forms a central link between land use and stream metabolism, besides known physical controls including transient storage and light availability. 3. To examine these hypotheses, we studied 33 streams in north-eastern Austria, a region with diverse land use ranging from semi-natural, forested areas to agricultural areas and settlements. We analysed DOM composition by absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy, including modelling excitation–emission matrices with parallel factor analysis. We then opposed these data to GPP and ER estimated by fitting a metabolism model to single-station diurnal oxygen records. 4. Structural equation modelling revealed land use as a control on light conditions, DOM composition and concentration and nutrient concentrations, which together ultimately shaped GPP and ER. In particular, humified, coloured and aromatic DOM of predominantly terrestrial origin was prevalent in coniferous forest catchments and increased stream ER. Agricultural and urban areas enriched streams with phosphorous and nitrogen, which increased ER and GPP. Besides nutrients, GPP seemed to be weakly correlated with light availability and – in contrast to our hypothesis – left only a weak imprint on DOM composition. 5. Land-use change is rated as the most pervasive human influence on natural ecosystems and our results highlight its impact on aquatic GPP and ER in streams. To understand the role of inland waters in the global C cycle will require mechanistic understanding of ecosystem metabolism, which notably includes organic matter quality as a hitherto underappreciated key player.},

abstract = {Ecology may benefit from long term, large scale experiments on low intensity farming to test theoretical principles and convert them into practical lessons. One century of land conversion in the Argentine pampas, and its effect on critical ecological properties, were analysed and discussed. Land transformation has resulted in significant changes of land use, land cover, energy flow, nutrient dynamics, hydrology, and the trade-offs between productivity, stability and sustainability. The analytical procedure involved the complementary utilisation of different data sources and approaches. The study was focused on large geographical scales: the entire pampas and its five ecoregions. Results were interpreted under the theoretical framework of succession in ecology. The historical conversion of natural grasslands into cultivated grasslands and croplands was not homogeneous, determining a variety of land use and land cover patterns. Due to its higher productivity, much more energy, nutrients and water were mobilised in the rolling pampas than in the other ecoregions. This study provides lessons about how the energy flow, the nutrient dynamics and the hydrological process are modified by land transformation under low external-input conditions. Technical coefficients to be applied in emerging fields of environment administration such as ecological-monitoring, environmental accounting and auditing, agro-ecological certification, land evaluation and allocation, and land management, can also be supplied by this kind of studies.},

Here, we synthesize knowl-edge of the processing of C, N, and P together in freshwaters from land to the ocean. We compared flux esti-mates into and out of the N and P " pipes " and showed the net removal rates of N and P by inland waters were less than those for C. The C : N : P stoichiometry of inland water inputs vs. exports differed due to large respiratory C and N losses, and efficient P burial in inland waters. Residence time plays a critical role in the processing of these elements through the pipe, where higher water residence times from streams to lakes results in substantial increases in C : N, C : P, and N : P ratios.},

abstract = {Although recent studies indicate that fluvial systems can be accumulation areas for microplastics (MPs), the common perception still treats rivers and streams primarily as pure transport vectors for MPs. In this study we investigate the occurrence of MPs in a yet unnoticed but essential compartment of fluvial ecosystems - the hyporheic zone (HZ). Larger MP particles (500-5,000 µm) were detected using attenuated total reflectance (ATR) - Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Our analysis of MPs (500-5,000 µm) in five freeze cores extracted for the Roter Main River sediments (Germany) showed that MPs were detectable down to a depth of 0.6 m below the streambed in low abundances (≪1 particle per kg dry weight). Additionally, one core was analyzed as an example for smaller MPs (20-500 µm) with focal plane array (FPA)- based µFTIR spectroscopy. Highest MP abundances ({\~{}}30,000 particles per kg dry weight) were measured for pore scale particles (20-50 µm). The detected high abundances indicate that the HZ can be a significant accumulation area for pore scale MPs (20-50 µm), a size fraction that yet is not considered in literature. As the HZ is known as an important habitat for invertebrates representing the base of riverine food webs, aquatic food webs can potentially be threatened by the presence of MPs in the HZ. Hyporheic exchange is discussed as a potential mechanism leading to a transfer of pore scale MPs from surface flow into streambed sediments and as a potential vector for small MPs to enter the local aquifer. MPs in the HZ therefore may be a potential risk for drinking water supplies, particularly during drinking water production via river bank filtration.},

abstract = {Ecosystem element cycles can be tightly linked by both abiotic and biotic processes. Evidence for multi-element limitation (i.e., colimitation) of a variety of ecosystem processes is growing rapidly, yet our ability to quantify patterns of coupled nutrient dynamics at the ecosystem level has been hindered by logistical and methodological constraints. Here we quantify coupled nitrogen and phosphorus uptake kinetics in three oligotrophic mountain streams by using novel experimental techniques that quantify colimitation dynamics across a range of nutrient concentrations and stoichiometries. We show that relative demand for NO3-N and PO4-P varied across streams, but that short term availability of one nutrient consistently resulted in elevated, but variable, uptake of the other nutrient at all sites. We used temporally offset, pulsed nutrient additions to parameterize dual-nutrient Michaelis–Menten uptake surface models that represent NO3-N and PO4-P uptake at any given concentration or dissolved NO3-N:PO4-P stoichiometry. Our results indicated that the uptake of N and P were strongly enhanced in the presence of the other nutrient. Surface models quantitatively reflect patterns of colimitation and multi-element demand in streams, and should allow for parameterization of more realistic stream network models that explicitly account for interactions among element cycles.},

abstract = {Spatial variation in fish densities across river networks suggests that the influence of food and habitat resources on assemblages varies greatly throughout watersheds. Conceptual models predict that in situ primary production should vary with river characteristics, but the influence of autochthonous resource availability on the capacity for river reaches to support fish is poorly understood. We estimated primary production throughout the South Fork and Middle Fork of the John Day River, Oregon, by measuring diel cycles in dissolved oxygen (DO) during July 2013. Using these data, we (1) evaluated the extent to which juvenile salmonid abundance and resource limitation correlated with areas of high gross primary production (GPP), (2) developed models to predict GPP from both site-level measurements and remotely sensed data, and (3) made predictions of GPP across the entirety of the Middle Fork John Day River (MFJD) network and assessed the utility of these spatially continuous predictions for describing variation fish densities at broad scales. We produced reliable estimates of GPP at sites where DO loggers were deployed using measurements of solar exposure, water temperature, and conductivity measured at each site, as well as surrogates for these data estimated from remote sensing data sources. Estimates of GPP across fish sampling sites explained, on average, 58-63{\%} of the variation in juvenile salmonid densities during the summer sampling period, and 51-83{\%} during the fall sampling period, while continuous network predictions of GPP explained 44{\%} of the variation in fish densities across 29 km of the MFJD. Further, GPP explained nearly half of the variation in juvenile steelhead dietary resource limitation, as inferred from bioenergetics modeling results. These results comprise a first effort at quantifying variation in autochthonous production across an entire river network and, importantly, provide a much-needed food-web context for guiding more effective fish and habitat management. {\textcopyright} 2018 Saunders et al.},

abstract = {Run-off from impervious surfaces has pervasive and serious consequences for urban streams, but the detrimental effects of urban stormwater can be lessened by disconnecting impervious surfaces and redirecting run-off to decentralized green infrastructure. This study used a before-after-control-impact design, in which streets served as subcatchments, to quantify hydrologic effectiveness of street-scale investments in green infrastructure, such as street-connected bioretention cells, rain gardens and rain barrels. On the two residential treatment streets, voluntary participation resulted in 32.2{\%} and 13.5{\%} of parcels having green infrastructure installed over a 2-year period. Storm sewer discharge was measured before and after green infrastructure implementation, and peak discharge, total run-off volume and hydrograph lags were analysed. On the street with smaller lots and lower participation, green infrastructure installation succeeded in reducing peak discharge by up to 33{\%} and total storm run-off by up to 40{\%}. On the street with larger lots and higher participation, there was no significant reduction in peak or total stormflows, but on this street, contemporaneous street repairs may have offset improvements. On the street with smaller lots, lag times increased following the first phase of green infrastructure construction, in which streetside bioretention cells were built with underdrains. In the second phase, lag times did not change further, because bioretention cells were built without underdrains and water was removed from the system, rather than just delayed. We conclude that voluntary green infrastructure retrofits that include treatment of street run-off can be effective for substantially reducing stormwater but that small differences in design and construction can be important for determining the level of the benefit.},

abstract = {Stream metabolism is affected by both natural and human-induced processes. While metabolism has multiple implications for ecological processes, relatively little is known about how metabolic rates are influenced by land use in tropical streams. In this study, we assessed the metabolic characteristics and related environmental factors of six streams located in a transition area from Cerrado to Atlantic Forest (S{\~{a}}o Carlos/Brazil). Three streams were relatively preserved, while three were flowing through more agriculturally and/or urban impacted watersheds. Surface water samples were analyzed for biological and physico-chemical parameters as well as discharge and percentage of canopy cover. Metabolism was determined through the single-station method to estimate gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and net ecosystem production (NEP) with BAyesian Single-station Estimation (BASE). Nutrient concentrations tended to be higher in impacted versus preserved streams (e.g., average total phosphorus between 0.028-0.042 mg L-1 and 0.009-0.038 mg L-1, respectively). Average canopy cover varied between 58 and 77{\%}, with no significant spatial or seasonal variation. All streams were net heterotrophic (ER exceeded GPP) in all sampling periods. GPP rates were always lower than 0.7 gO2 m-2 d-1 in all streams and ER varied from 0.6 to 42.1 gO2 m-2 d-1.  Linear Mixed-Effect models showed that depth, discharge, velocity and total phosphorus are the most important predictors for GPP. For ER, depth, velocity and canopy cover are significant potential predictors. Canopy cover was the main light limiting factor and influenced stream metabolism. Our findings reinforced the concepts that shifts in the shading effect provided by vegetation (e.g., through deforestation) or changes in discharge (e.g., through land use conversion or water abstractions) can impact freshwater metabolism. Our study suggests that human activities in low latitude areas can alter tropical streams' water quality, ecosystem function, and the degree of riparian influence. Our data showed that tropical streams can be especially responsive to increases of organic matter inputs leading to high respiration rates and net heterotrophy, and this should be considered to support management and restoration efforts.},

abstract = {Water movement in upland humid watersheds from the soil surface to the stream is often described using the concept of translatory flow1,2, which assumes that water entering the soil as precipitation displaces the water that was present previously, pushing it deeper into the soil and eventually into the stream. Within this framework, water at any soil depth is well mixed and plants extract the same water that eventually enters the stream2. Here we present water-isotope data from various pools throughout a small watershed in the Cascade Mountains, Oregon, USA. Our data imply that a pool of tightly bound water that is retained in the soil and used by trees does not participate in translatory flow, mix with mobile water or enter the stream. Instead, water from initial rainfall events after rainless summers is locked into small pores with low matric potential until transpiration empties these pores during following dry summers. Winter rainfall does not displace this tightly bound water. As transpiration and stormflow are out of phase in the Mediterranean climate of our study site, two separate sets of water bodies with different isotopic characteristics exist in trees and streams. We conclude that complete mixing of water within the soil cannot be assumed for similar hydroclimatic regimes as has been done in the past3,4. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Distinct seasonal patterns in streamwater nutrient and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations are evident in the data record from 7 years of weekly sampling in the West Fork of Walker Branch (WB) and 4 years of weekly sampling in a nearby stream, upper White Oak Creek (WOC), both first-order streams in the Ridge and Valley Province of eastern Tennessee. Concentrations of NO3 and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in both streams showed a repeated pattern of annual maxima in summer and biannual minima in autumn and spring. Concentrations of DOC in WB exhibited distinct autumn maxima. To determine whether temporal variations in catchment hydrological processes could explain the seasonal nutrient and DOC variations in WB, we used an end-member mixing analysis involving Ca and SO4 concentrations to separate stream discharge into three catchment flow paths of differing nutrient concentrations. Stream NO3, SRP, and DOC concentrations were predicted solely on the basis of temporal variation in the importance of these flow paths and measurements of nutrient concentrations for the different flow paths. Ratios of observed/predicted concentrations in stream water near 1.0 suggested that catchment effects alone explained streamwater concentrations, whereas ratios substantially different from 1.0 suggested that in-stream processes were important determinants of streamwater concentrations. Observed/predicted NO3 and SRP concentration ratios showed repeated annual patterns with values closer to 1.0 during winter and summer (generally 0.8-1.2) and minima ({\textless}0.6) in spring and autumn, suggesting substantial in-stream net uptake at these times. Observed/predicted DOC concentration ratios were more variable and generally ≤1 but did show consistent autumn maxima ({\textgreater}2.5), indicating substantial in-stream DOC generation at this time. Observed/predicted ratios for all nutrients were generally less variable and were closer to 1.0 at high flow compared to low flow, suggesting that in-stream controls on streamwater chemistry are less important at high discharge than at low discharge. Our results indicate two general modes of control of stream nutrient concentrations: (1) catchment control via seasonal variation in the dominant hydrologic pathway (greater proportion of deep groundwater in summer), which produces lower winter and higher summer concentrations, and (2) in-stream control via high rates of net nutrient uptake during the spring (primarily by autotrophs) and autumn (primarily by heterotrophs).},

Lodgepole comprised {\textgreater}90{\%} of the overstory basal area and mature spruce and fir were present in both mortality levels, though live basal area and disturbance history differed.

Pine advance regeneration, established prior to outbreak, was more dense in high mortality than moderate mortality sites (930 stems ha−1 vs. 310 stems ha−1), but the trend was generally the opposite for the other conifers. Lodgepole recruitment increased and subalpine fir decreased with greater forest floor light availability. All species grew faster in high mortality areas than their counterparts in moderate mortality areas. However, in high mortality areas pine grew faster than the more shade tolerant species, and in moderate mortality areas spruce and fir grew faster than pine. These species-specific responses to the degree of overstory mortality will influence future stand composition and rate of forest recovery after mountain pine beetle outbreaks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {The absolute concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and their relative availabilities (N:P stoichiometry) can influence numerous ecological processes. In streams, N:P stoichiometry is influenced by different hydrologic and biogeochemical processes that also affect the downstream transport of these nutrients to receiving waters. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) deposition, a widespread geochemical process in alkaline streams and other aquatic ecosystems, can lower phosphate concentrations and, potentially, decrease P availability relative to N availability. We evaluated the effects of CaCO3 deposition on stream water stoichiometry using a 3-year dataset of stream physicochemistry and several metrics of CaCO3 deposition across three streams in the Huachuca Mountains of southern Arizona, USA. CaCO3 deposition rates varied across and within streams, with benthic coverage of travertine as high as 70 {\%} and deposition rates up to 8.3 $\mu$g Ca2+ L−1 m−1. Redundancy analysis revealed a strong, negative correlation between stream water phosphate concentrations and CaCO3 deposition rates, a relationship that also extended to total P concentrations, and a strong, positive correlation between inorganic N concentrations and CaCO3 deposition rates. Furthermore, we found a significant positive relationship between CaCO3 deposition rates and N:P ratios. These results support the role of coprecipitation of phosphate with CaCO3 deposition in reducing P supply. They also suggest that reduced concentrations of P in the water column may reduce biological N uptake, amplifying the stoichiometric signal of CaCO3 deposition.},

abstract = {Scaling is an integral component of ecology and earth science. To date, the ability to determine the importance of air–water gas exchange across large spatial scales is hampered partly by our ability to scale the gas transfer velocity and stream hydraulics. Here we report on a metadata analysis of 563 direct gas tracer release experiments that examines scaling laws for the gas transfer velocity. We found that the gas transfer velocity scales with the product of stream slope and velocity, which is in alignment with theory on stream energy dissipation. In addition to providing equations that predict the gas transfer velocity based on stream hydraulics, we used our hydraulic data set to report a new set of hydraulic exponents and coefficients that allow the prediction of stream width, depth, and velocity based on discharge. Finally, we report a new table of gas Schmidt number dependencies to allow researchers to estimate a gas transfer velocity using our equation for many gasses of interest.},

abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon, DOC, is an important source of carbon for stream heterotrophs. In many systems, bacteria and fungi are carbon limited. Thus, carbon availability may control both the availability and the dynamics of other nutrients (N or P) in heterotrophic systems. To test the interdependence of C and N cycles in forested streams, we continuously added DOC, as potassium acetate, to the stream draining Watershed six at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, for six weeks during summer 1999. For two months prior to and throughout the addition, we monitored streamwater NO3- and NH4+ concentrations throughout the 70-m upstream reference and the 70-m downstream treatment reaches. We also estimated uptake lengths and uptake rates of NO3- and NH4+ using back-to-back, short-term enrichments in both the treatment and reference reaches. The change in NO3- concentration during the NH4+ addition was used to estimate whole-stream nitrification. Once before the DOC addition and once during the DOC addition we measured denitrification rates and whole-stream respiration in both reaches. In the treatment reach, the increase in labile DOC caused nitrate concentrations to decrease from pretreatment concentrations during the DOC addition. Metabolism was higher in the treatment than in the reference reach during that addition, while metabolism had been similar in the two reaches before the DOC addition. Prior to that addition, uptake lengths for both NO3- and NH4+ were longer in the treatment reach than in the reference reach. During the DOC addition, the uptake lengths for both forms of nitrogen were much shorter in the treatment than in the reference reach. Contrary to expectations, the DOC enrichment did not lead to increased rates of denitrification. The principal effect of DOC enrichment was to stimulate bacterial growth, leading to high respiration and a corresponding increase in the assimilative demand for nitrogen. Results from this experiment demonstrate tight linkages between DOC and nitrogen availability in headwater streams.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd/CNRS. Carbon and nitrogen cycles are coupled through both stoichiometric requirements for microbial biomass and dissimilatory metabolic processes in which microbes catalyse reduction-oxidation reactions. Here, we integrate stoichiometric theory and thermodynamic principles to explain the commonly observed trade-off between high nitrate and high organic carbon concentrations, and the even stronger trade-off between high nitrate and high ammonium concentrations, across a wide range of aquatic ecosystems. Our results suggest these relationships are the emergent properties of both microbial biomass stoichiometry and the availability of terminal electron acceptors. Because elements with multiple oxidation states (i.e. nitrogen, manganese, iron and sulphur) serve as both nutrients and sources of chemical energy in reduced environments, both assimilative demand and dissimilatory uses determine their concentrations across broad spatial gradients. Conceptual and quantitative models that integrate rather than independently examine thermodynamic, stoichiometric and evolutionary controls on biogeochemical cycling are essential for understanding local to global biogeochemical patterns.},

abstract = {The water quality and ecosystem health of river corridors depend on the biogeochemical processes occurring in the hyporheic zones (HZs) of the beds and banks of rivers. HZs in riverbeds often form because of bed forms. Despite widespread and persistent variation in river flow, how the discharge- and grain size-dependent geometry of bed forms and how bed form migration collectively and systematically affects hyporheic exchange flux, solute transport, and biogeochemical reaction rates are unknown. We investigated these linked processes through morphodynamically consistent multiphysics numerical simulation experiments. Several realistic ripple geometries based on bed form stability criteria using mean river flow velocity and median sediment grain size were designed. Ripple migration rates were estimated based primarily on the river velocity. The ripple geometries and migration rates were used to drive hyporheic flow and reactive transport models which quantified HZ nitrogen transformation. Results from fixed bed form simulations were compared with matching migrating bed form scenarios. We found that the turnover exchange due to ripple migration has a large impact on reactant supply and reaction rates. The nitrate removal efficiency increased asymptotically with Damk{\"{o}}hler number for both mobile and immobile ripples, but the immobile ripple always had a higher nitrate removal efficiency. Since moving ripples remove less nitrogen, and may even be net nitrifying at times, consideration for bed form morphodynamics may therefore lead to reduction of model-based estimates of denitrification. The connection between nitrate removal efficiency and Damk{\"{o}}hler number can be integrated into frameworks for quantifying transient, network-scale, HZ nitrate dynamics.},

CO {\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} uptake and transpiration at 405 m peaked in spring (March to May) and declined in summer; gas exchange at 1160 and 2015 m continued year-round; gas exchange at 2700 m peaked in summer and ceased in winter. A phenological threshold occurred between 2015 and 2700 m, associated with the development of winter dormancy. Annual ET and Gross Primary Production were greatest at 1160 and 2015 m and reduced at 405 m coincident with less P, and at 2700 m coincident with colder temperatures. The large decline in ET above 2015 m raises the possibility that an upslope redistribution of vegetation with climate change could cause a large increase in upper elevation ET.

abstract = {[1] Over the past 3 decades, nutrient spiraling has become a unifying paradigm for stream biogeochemical research. This paper presents ( 1) a quantitative synthesis of the nutrient spiraling literature and ( 2) application of these data to elucidate trends in nutrient spiraling within stream networks. Results are based on 404 individual experiments on ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NO3), and phosphate (PO4) from 52 published studies. Sixty-nine percent of the experiments were performed in first- and second-order streams, and 31{\%} were performed in third- to fifth-order streams. Uptake lengths, S-w, of NH4 (median = 86 m) and PO4 (median = 96 m) were significantly different (alpha = 0.05) than NO3 (median = 236 m). Areal uptake rates of NH4 (median = 28 mu g m(-2) min(-1)) were significantly different than NO3 and PO4 (median = 15 and 14 mu g m(-2) min(-1), respectively). There were significant differences among NH4, NO3, and PO4 uptake velocity (median = 5, 1, and 2 mm min(-1), respectively). Correlation analysis results were equivocal on the effect of transient storage on nutrient spiraling. Application of these data to a stream network model showed that recycling (defined here as stream length divided by S-w) of NH4 and NO3 generally increased with stream order, while PO4 recycling remained constant along a first- to fifth-order stream gradient. Within this hypothetical stream network, cumulative NH4 uptake decreased slightly with stream order, while cumulative NO3 and PO4 uptake increased with stream order. These data suggest the importance of larger rivers to nutrient spiraling and the need to consider how stream networks affect nutrient flux between terrestrial and marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {Tracer experiments are valuable tools for analyzing the transport characteristics of streams and their interactions with shallow groundwater. The focus of this work is the design of tracer studies in high-gradient stream systems subject to advection, dispersion, groundwater inflow, and exchange between the active channel and zones in surface or subsurface water where flow is stagnant or slow moving. We present a methodology for (1) evaluating and comparing alternative stream tracer experiment designs and (2) identifying those combinations of stream transport properties that pose limitations to parameter estimation and therefore a challenge to tracer test design. The methodology uses the concept of global parameter uncertainty analysis, which couples solute transport simulation with parameter uncertainty analysis in a Monte Carlo framework. Two general conclusions resulted from this work. First, the solute injection and sampling strategy has an important effect on the reliability of transport parameter estimates. We found that constant injection with sampling through concentration rise, plateau, and fall provided considerably more reliable parameter estimates than a pulse injection across the spectrum of transport scenarios likely encountered in high-gradient streams. Second, for a given tracer test design, the uncertainties in mass transfer and storage-zone parameter estimates are strongly dependent on the experimental Damkohler number, DaI, which is a dimensionless combination of the rates of exchange between the stream and storage zones, the stream-water velocity, and the stream reach length of the experiment. Parameter uncertainties are lowest at DaI values on the order of 1.0. When DaI values are much less than 1.0 (owing to high velocity, long exchange timescale, and/or short reach length), parameter uncertainties are high because only a small amount of tracer interacts with storage zones in the reach. For the opposite conditions (DaI {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 1.0), solute exchange rates are fast relative to stream-water velocity and all solute is exchanged with the storage zone over the experimental reach. As DaI increases, tracer dispersion caused by hyporheic exchange eventually reaches an equilibrium condition and storage-zone exchange parameters become essentially nonidentifiable.},

abstract = {Streams are potential hotspots for retention and removal of NO(3)(-), and understanding the mechanisms that enhance NO(3)(-) reactivity in stream systems is critical for predicting and preventing eutrophication. Both dissolved organic C (DOC) and dissolved O(2) (DO) influence NO(3)(-) removal processes. Assessing the individual impacts of NO(3)(-), DO, and DOC concentrations on stream NO(3)(-) removal is difficult because these factors covary and are coupled through the C and N cycles. We used an experimental approach to quantify the influences of NO(3)(-), DOC, and DO on NO(3)(-) transport in headwater streams of the Ipswich and Parker River watersheds (Massachusetts, USA) with contrasting levels of DOC and DO. In a 1(st) set of experiments, we added NO(3)(-) to address how uptake kinetics differed between a low-DO/high-DOC stream (Cedar Swamp Creek) and a high-DO/low-DOC stream (Cart Creek). In a 2(nd) set of experiments, we manipulated, for the first time at the reach scale, both DO and DOC in a factorial experiment. DO was added to the low-DO stream by injecting O(2) and was removed from the high-DO stream by adding sodium sulfite. DOC was added both alone and in combination with the DO manipulations. NO(3)(-) concentration was an important control of NO(3)(-) uptake velocity in our study streams, consistent with previous findings. The results of the DOC and DO manipulations suggested that DO determines whether a stream has net NO(3)(-) uptake or production and that the presence of DOC magnifies the DO response processes. Addition of DOC by itself did not lead to increased NO(3)(-) uptake. In addition, we observed organic matter priming effects, wherein the addition of labile organic matter resulted in accelerated metabolism of naturally occurring DOC in the water column. Priming effects have not been reported previously in stream systems. Results from our experiments suggest that NO(3)(-) uptake in streams might arise from complex interactions among DOC, DO, and NO(3)(-), and ultimately, from the influence of DO on dominant stream processes.},

However, current methods for measuring nutrient uptake length are often impractical, expensive, or demonstrably incorrect. We have developed a new method to estimate ambient nutrient uptake lengths using field experiments involving several levels of nutrient addition. Data analysis involves plotting nutrient addition uptake lengths versus added concentration and extrapolating to the negative ambient concentration. This method is relatively easy, inexpensive, and based on sound theoretical development. It is more accurate than the commonly used method involving a single nutrient addition. The utility of the method is supported by field studies directly comparing our new method with isotopic tracer methods for determining uptake lengths of phosphorus, ammonium, and nitrate. Our method also provides parameters for comparing potential nutrient limitation among streams.},

abstract = {1. Nutrient spiralling provides a conceptual framework and a whole-system approach to investigate ecosystem responses to environmental changes. We use spiralling metrics to examine how the coupling of nitrogen and phosphorus uptake varies between streams dominated by either heterotrophic (i.e. bacteria-dominated) or autotrophic (algal-dominated) microbial communities. 2. Algae generally exhibit greater capacity to store nutrients than bacteria because of differences in cellular structures. These differences led us to hypothesise that the uptake of N and P in heterotrophic ecosystems should have reduced stoichiometric variation in response to changes in supply N:P compared to autotrophic ecosystems when assimilation dominates nutrient uptake. 3. To test this hypothesis, we used an array of serial nutrient additions in several streams in the South Fork Eel River watershed in Northern California. In one set of experiments, N and P were added alone and simultaneously in separate experiments to two small, heterotrophic streams to assess uptake rates and interactions between nutrient cycles. In a second set of experiments, N and P were added simultaneously at a range of N:P in one heterotrophic and one autotrophic stream to assess differences in uptake responses to changes in supply N:P. 4. Results of these experiments suggest two important conclusions. First, increased N supply significantly shortened P uptake lengths, while P addition had little impact on N uptake in both streams, indicating that uptake of non-limiting nutrients is tightly coupled to the availability of the limiting element. Second, changes in P uptake and uptake ratios (UN:UP) with increased supply N:P supported our hypothesis that heterotrophic streams are more homeostatic in their responses to changes in nutrient supply than autotrophic streams, suggesting that physiological controls on nutrient use scale up to influence ecosystem-scale patterns in nutrient cycling. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {SUMMARY 1. Agriculture is a major contributor of non-point source pollution to surface waters in the midwestern United States, resulting in eutrophication of freshwater aquatic ecosystems and development of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Agriculturally influenced streams are diverse in morphology and have variable nutrient concentrations. Understanding how nutrients are transformed and retained within agricultural streams may aid in mitigating increased nutrient export to downstream ecosystems. 2. We studied six agriculturally influenced streams in Indiana and Michigan to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the factors controlling nutrient retention and export in agricultural streams using nutrient addition and isotopic tracer studies. 3. Metrics of nutrient uptake indicated that nitrate uptake was saturated in these streams whereas ammonium and phosphorus uptake increased with higher concentrations. Phosphorus uptake was likely approaching saturation as evidenced by decreasing uptake velocities with concentration; ammonium uptake velocity also declined with concentra- tion, though not significantly. 4. Higher whole-stream uptake rates of phosphorus and ammonium were associated with the observed presence of stream autotrophs (e.g. algae and macrophytes). However, there was no significant relationship between measures of nutrient uptake and stream metabolism. Water-column nutrient concentrations were positively correlated with gross primary production but not community respiration. 5. Overall, nutrient uptake and metabolism were affected by nutrient concentrations in these agriculturally influenced streams. Biological uptake of ammonium and phosphorus was not saturated, although nitrate uptake did appear to be saturated in these ecosystems. Biological activity in agriculturally influenced streams is higher relative to more pristine streams and this increased biological activity likely influences nutrient retention and transport to downstream ecosystems.},

abstract = {Pollution abatement through phosphorus and nitrogen retention is a key ecosystem service provided by streams. Human activities have been changing in-stream nutrient concentrations, thereby altering lotic ecosystem functioning, especially in developing countries. We estimated nutrient uptake metrics (ambient uptake length, areal uptake rate, and uptake velocity) for nitrate (NO3-N), ammonium (NH4-N), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in four tropical Cerrado headwater streams during 2017, through whole-stream nutrient addition experiments. According to multiple regression models, ambient SRP concentration was an important explanatory variable of nutrient uptake. Further, best models included ambient NO3-N and water velocity (for NO3-N uptake metrics), dissolved oxygen (DO) and canopy cover (for NH4-N); and DO, discharge, water velocity, and temperature (for SRP). The best kinetic models describing nutrient uptake were efficiency-loss (R2 from 0.47-0.88) and first-order models (R2 from 0.60-0.85). NO3-N, NH4-N, and SRP uptake in these streams seemed coupled as a result of complex interactions of biotic P limitation, abiotic P cycling processes, and the preferential uptake of NH4-N among N-forms. Global change effects on these tropical streams, such as temperature increase and nutrient enrichment due to urban and agricultural expansion, may have adverse and partially unpredictable impacts on whole-stream nutrient processing.},

abstract = {We investigated vegetation structure, water partitioning dynamics and vegetation greening from 2000 through 2012 in three catchments draining north and east aspects of Redondo Peak in northern New Mexico. Vegetation structure was quantified from 1-m lidar data, while vegetation greening was quantified using remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Hydrological partitioning at the catchment scale was estimated with a metric of catchment-scale water fluxes and vegetation water use [Horton index (HI)]. The predominantly north-facing catchment, when compared with the other two eastern catchments, receives less solar radiation, exhibits less forest cover and smaller biomass and has more surface run-off ({\~{}}15{\%} of P) as a consequence of a smaller vaporization (85{\%} of P) and smaller vegetation water consumption (HI = 0{\textperiodcentered}85). Moreover, the north-facing catchment showed smaller peak NDVI values (5{\textperiodcentered}98) and shorter growing season length (121 days) as a consequence of energy limitation. In contrast, the two eastern catchments receive larger solar radiation and have more biomass and forest cover ({\textgreater}76{\%}), smaller surface run-off ({\textless}10{\%} P) and higher vaporization ({\textgreater}90{\%} P) and vegetation water consumption (HI = 0{\textperiodcentered}95). The eastern catchments had larger vegetation greening (6{\textperiodcentered}28–6{\textperiodcentered}58) and a longer growing season (148–160 days). Snowpack conditions, such as maximum snow water equivalent and duration of the snow on the ground, explain over 95{\%} of water partitioning (HI) that in turn influenced annual vegetation greening (R2 = 0{\textperiodcentered}48–0{\textperiodcentered}67; p {\textless} 0{\textperiodcentered}05). This catchment-scale study in perennial streams indicates that terrain aspect at a similar altitude (2700–3435 m) strongly controls energy, water distribution and vegetation productivity in high-elevation ecosystems.

However, the transport of carbon through aquatic environments has not been quantitatively integrated in the context of terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we present the first integrated assessment, to our knowledge, of freshwater carbon fluxes for the conterminous United States, where 106 (range: 71–149) teragrams of carbon per year (TgC⋅y−1) is exported downstream or emitted to the atmosphere and sedimentation stores 21 (range: 9–65) TgC⋅y−1 in lakes and reservoirs. We show that there is significant regional variation in aquatic carbon flux, but verify that emission across stream and river surfaces represents the dominant flux at 69 (range: 36–110) TgC⋅y−1 or 65{\%} of the total aquatic carbon flux for the conterminous United States. Comparing our results with the output of a suite of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), we suggest that within the current modeling framework, calculations of net ecosystem production (NEP) defined as terrestrial only may be overestimated by as much as 27{\%}. However, the internal production and mineralization of carbon in freshwaters remain to be quantified and would reduce the effect of including aquatic carbon fluxes within calculations of terrestrial NEP. Reconciliation of carbon mass–flux interactions between terrestrial and aquatic carbon sources and sinks will require significant additional research and modeling capacity.},

abstract = {Microbial metabolism couples elemental reactions, driving biogeochemical cycles. Assimilatory coupling of elemental cycles, such as the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus cycles, occurs when these elements are incorporated into biomass or released through its decomposition. In addition, many microbes are capable of dissimilatory coupling, catalyzing energy-releasing reactions linked to transformations in the oxidation state of elements, and releasing the transformed elements to the environment. Different inorganic elements provide varying amounts of energy yield, and the interaction of these processes creates a microbial energy economy. Dissimilatory reactions involving C, N, iron, and sulfur provide particularly important examples where microbially mediated oxidation-reduction (redox) transformations affect nutrient availability for net primary production, greenhouse-gas emissions, levels of contaminants and natural toxic factors, and other ecosystem dynamics. Recent discoveries of previously unrecognized microbial dissimilatory processes are leading to reevaluation of traditional perceptions of biogeochemical cycles. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {The foundations of river restoration science rest comfortably in the fields of geology, hydrology, and engineering, and yet, the impetus for many, if not most, stream restoration projects is biological recovery. Although Lane's stream balance equation from the mid-1950s captured the dynamic equilibrium between the amount of stream flow, the slope of the channel, and the amount and calibre of sediment, it completely ignored biology. Similarly, most of the stream classification systems used in river restoration design today do not explicitly include biology as a primary driver of stream form and process. To address this omission, we cast biology as an equal partner with geology and hydrology, forming a triumvirate that governs stream morphology and evolution. To represent this, we have created the stream evolution triangle, a conceptual model that explicitly accounts for the influences of geology, hydrology, and biology. Recognition of biology as a driver leads to improved understanding of reach-scale morphology and the dynamic response mechanisms responsible for stream evolution and adjustment following natural or anthropogenic disturbance, including stream restoration. Our aim in creating the stream evolution triangle is not to exclude or supersede existing stream classifications and evolutionary models but to provide a broader “thinking space” within which they can be framed and reconsidered, thus facilitating thought outside of the alluvial box.},

abstract = {River networks modify material transfer from land to ocean. Understanding the factors regulating this function for different gaseous, dissolved, and particulate constituents is critical to quantify the local and global effects of climate and land use change. We propose the River Network Saturation (RNS) concept as a generalization of how river network regulation of material fluxes declines with increasing flows due to imbalances between supply and demand at network scales. River networks have a tendency to become saturated (supply ≫ demand) under higher flow conditions because supplies increase faster than sink processes. However, the flow thresholds under which saturation occurs depends on a variety of factors, including the inherent process rate for a given constituent and the abundance of lentic waters such as lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and fluvial wetlands within the river network. As supply increases, saturation at network scales is initially limited by previously unmet demand in downstream aquatic ecosystems. The RNS concept describes a general tendency of river network function that can be used to compare the fate of different constituents among river networks. New approaches using nested in situ high-frequency sensors and spatially extensive synoptic techniques offer the potential to test the RNS concept in different settings. Better understanding of when and where river networks saturate for different constituents will allow for the extrapolation of aquatic function to broader spatial scales and therefore provide information on the influence of river function on continental element cycles and help identify policy priorities.},

abstract = {Dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is an abundant but poorly understood pool of N in many ecosystems. We assessed DON cycling in a N-limited headwater forest stream via whole-ecosystem additions of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and labile dissolved organic matter (DOM), hydrologic transport and biogeochemical modeling, and laboratory experiments with native sediments. We sampled surface and subsurface waters to understand how interaction among hydrologic exchange, DIN, DON, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) influence stream N losses at summer baseflow. Added DON was taken up rapidly from the water column at rates exceeding DOC and DIN. A significant fraction of this DON was mineralized and nitrified. Combined DON and NO3-N uptake lengths resulted in spiraling lengths of ∼210 m, suggesting the potential for multiple transformations of labile N loads within catchment boundaries. Simultaneous addition of DIN increased DOM uptake, but more so for C, resulting in an upward shift in the C:N ratio of uptake. Sediment incubations also showed a strong biotic influence on DOC and DON dynamics. Despite efficient uptake of added DOM, background DON and high molecular mass DOC concentrations increased downstream, resulting in higher DOM loads than could be accounted for by groundwater discharge and suggesting net release of less bioavailable forms from the channel/hyporheic zone. At the same time, subsurface DOM was characterized by very low C:N ratios and a disproportionately large DON pool despite rapid hydrologic mixing with dilute and high C:N ratio surface waters. Analysis of expected DON loads from conservative hyporheic fluxes indicated that watershed losses of DON would have been seven times greater in the absence of apparent benthic demand, suggesting tight internal cycling of subsurface DON. Our study further demonstrates the potential for significant transformation of N in headwater streams before export to downstream ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {We studied trends in nutrient cycling and periphyton characteristics (biomass, species composition, productivity, and nutrient content) along longitudinal gradients in laboratory streams to test the hypothesis that upstream-downstream linkages produce distinct longitudinal patterns in stream ecosystems. Periphyton communities were grown under uniform light and now conditions in two 88-m-long laboratory streams created by connecting four channel segments (each 0.3 m wide and 22 m long) in series. At the end of 8 wk, large longitudinal declines in streamwater N and P concentrations were observed in each stream. Although chlorophyll a declined and the proportion of cyanobacteria in the periphyton increased with distance downstream, longitudinal trends in ash-free dry mass, gross primary productivity (GPP), and total respiration were not significant. In contrast, longitudinal trends in most of the parameters related to nutrient deficiency and cycling were significant. Chlorophyll-specific phosphatase activity and C:nutrient ratios in periphyton biomass increased from upstream to downstream, suggesting greater nutrient deficiency downstream. Ratios of net N uptake rate:GPP and net P uptake rate:GPP declined from upstream to downstream, suggesting that nutrient recycling supported a greater fraction of the algal nutrient demand downstream. Ratios of net:total P uptake rate also declined from upstream to downstream suggesting that a larger fraction of the total P uptake from stream water downstream was met by P recycled within the segment rather than by inputs from upstream. Within-segment recycling supplied only 10-25{\%} of P uptake from stream water in upstream segments but contributed 60-70{\%} of the P uptake from stream water in downstream segments. Finally, total P uptake rate:GPP ratio declined from upstream to downstream, suggesting that cycling of P within the periphyton mat was greater downstream than upstream. Together, our results showed that increased nutrient cycling can compensate for longitudinal declines in nutrient concentrations in stream water, preventing large longitudinal changes in periphyton biomass and productivity. Nutrient cycling and algal species composition were the characteristics showing strongest longitudinal linkage in these periphyton-dominated streams, whereas total biomass and productivity patterns were poorly related to longitudinal position.},

abstract = {Stoichiometric analyses can be used to investigate the linkages between N and C cycles and how these linkages influence biogeochemistry at many scales, from components of individual ecosystems up to the biosphere. N-specific NH 4+ uptake rates were measured in eight streams using short-term 15N tracer additions, and C to N ratios (C:N) were determined from living and non-living organic matter collected from ten streams. These data were also compared to previously published data compiled from studies of lakes, ponds, wetlands, forests, and tundra. There was a significant negative relationship between C:N and N-specific uptake rate; C:N could account for 41{\%} of the variance in N-specific uptake rate across all streams, and the relationship held in five of eight streams. Most of the variation in N-specific uptake rate was contributed by detrital and primary producer compartments with large values of C:N and small values for N-specific uptake rate. In streams, particulate materials are not as likely to move downstream as dissolved N, so if N is cycling in a particulate compartment, N retention is likely to be greater. Together, these data suggest that N retention may depend in part on C:N of living and non-living organic matter in streams. Factors that alter C:N of stream ecosystem compartments, such as removal of riparian vegetation or N fertilization, may influence the amount of retention attributed to these ecosystem compartments by causing shifts in stoichiometry. Our analysis suggests that C:N of ecosystem compartments can be used to link N-cycling models across streams. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {Water movement in upland humid watersheds from the soil surface to the stream is often described using the concept of translatory flow1,2, which assumes that water entering the soil as precipitation displaces the water that was present previously, pushing it deeper into the soil and eventually into the stream. Within this framework, water at any soil depth is well mixed and plants extract the same water that eventually enters the stream2. Here we present water-isotope data from various pools throughout a small watershed in the Cascade Mountains, Oregon, USA. Our data imply that a pool of tightly bound water that is retained in the soil and used by trees does not participate in translatory flow, mix with mobile water or enter the stream. Instead, water from initial rainfall events after rainless summers is locked into small pores with low matric potential until transpiration empties these pores during following dry summers. Winter rainfall does not displace this tightly bound water. As transpiration and stormflow are out of phase in the Mediterranean climate of our study site, two separate sets of water bodies with different isotopic characteristics exist in trees and streams. We conclude that complete mixing of water within the soil cannot be assumed for similar hydroclimatic regimes as has been done in the past3,4. {\textcopyright} 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {1. Single-station diel oxygen curves were used to monitor the oxygen metabolism of an intermittent, forested third-order stream (Fuirosos) in the Mediterranean area, over a period of 22 months. Ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary production (GPP) were estimated and related to organic matter inputs and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in order to understand the effect of the riparian forest on stream metabolism. 2. Annual ER was 1690 g O2 m-2 year-1 and annual GPP was 275 g O 2 m-2 year-1. Fuirosos was therefore a heterotrophic stream, with P:R ratios averaging 0.16. 3. GPP rates were relatively low, ranging from 0.05 to 1.9 g O2 m-2 day -1. The maximum values of GPP occurred during a few weeks in spring, and ended when the riparian canopy was fully closed. The phenology of the riparian vegetation was an important determinant of light availability, and consequently, of GPP. 4. On a daily scale, light and temperature were the most important factors governing the shape of photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I) curves. Several patterns could be generalised in the P-I relationships. Hysteresis-type curves were characteristic of late autumn and winter. Light saturation responses (that occurred at irradiances higher than 90 $\mu$E m-2 s-1) were characteristic of early spring. Linear responses occurred during late spring, summer and early autumn when there was no evidence of light saturation. 5. Rates of ER were high when compared with analogous streams, ranging from 0.4 to 32 g O2 m-2 day-1. ER was highest in autumn 2001, when organic matter accumulations on the streambed were extremely high. By contrast, the higher discharge in autumn 2002 prevented these accumulations and caused lower ER. The Mediterranean climate, and in its effect the hydrological regime, were mainly responsible for the temporal variation in benthic organic matter, and consequently of ER.},

abstract = {The 2010 Church's Park Fire burned beetle-killed lodgepole pine stands in Colorado, including recently salvage-logged areas, creating a fortuitous opportunity to compare the effects of salvage logging, wildfire and the combination of logging followed by wildfire. Here, we examine tree regeneration, surface fuels, understory plants, inorganic soil nitrogen and water infiltration in uncut and logged stands, outside and inside the fire perimeter. Subalpine fir recruitment was abundant in uncut, unburned, beetle-killed stands, whereas lodgepole pine recruitment was abundant in cut stands. Logging roughly doubled woody fuel cover and halved forb and shrub cover. Wildfire consumed all conifer seedlings in uncut and cut stands and did not stimulate new conifer regeneration within four years of the fire. Aspen regeneration, in contrast, was relatively unaffected by logging or burning, alone or combined. Wildfire also drastically reduced cover of soil organic horizons, fine woody fuels, graminoids and shrubs relative to unburned, uncut areas; moreover, the compound effect of logging and wildfire was generally similar to wildfire alone. This case study documents scarce conifer regeneration but ample aspen regeneration after a wildfire that occurred in the later stage of a severe beetle outbreak. Salvage logging had mixed effects on tree regeneration, understory plant and surface cover and soil nitrogen, but neither exacerbated nor ameliorated wildfire effects on those resources.},

abstract = {Abstract Gas exchange across the air–water boundary of streams and rivers is a globally large biogeochemical flux. Gas exchange depends on the solubility of the gas of interest, the gas concentrations of the air and water, and the gas exchange velocity (k), usually normalized to a Schmidt number of 600, referred to as k600. Gas exchange velocity is of intense research interest because it is problematic to estimate, is highly spatially variable, and has high prediction error. Theory dictates that molecular diffusivity and turbulence drives variation in k600 in flowing waters. We measure k600 via several methods from direct measures, gas tracer experiments, to modeling of diel changes in dissolved gas concentrations. Many estimates of k600 show that surface turbulence explains variation in k600 leading to predictive models based upon geomorphic and hydraulic variables. These variables include stream channel slope and stream flow velocity, the product of which, is proportional to the energy dissipation rate in streams and rivers. These empirical models provide understanding of the controls on k600, yet high residual variation in k600 show that these simple models are insufficient for predicting individual locations. The most appropriate method to estimate gas exchange depends on the scientific question along with the characteristics of the study sites. We provide a decision tree for selecting the best method to estimate k600 for individual river reaches to scaling to river networks.

These indices have been widely implemented within RS applications using different airborne and satellite platforms with recent advances using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Up to date, there is no unified mathematical expression that defines all VIs due to the complexity of different light spectra combinations, instrumentation, platforms, and resolutions used. Therefore, customized algorithms have been developed and tested against a variety of applications according to specific mathematical expressions that combine visible light radiation, mainly green spectra region, from vegetation, and nonvisible spectra to obtain proxy quantifications of the vegetation surface. In the real-world applications, optimization VIs are usually tailored to the specific application requirements coupled with appropriate validation tools and methodologies in the ground. The present study introduces the spectral characteristics of vegetation and summarizes the development of VIs and the advantages and disadvantages from different indices developed. This paper reviews more than 100 VIs, discussing their specific applicability and representativeness according to the vegetation of interest, environment, and implementation precision. Predictably, research, and development of VIs, which are based on hyperspectral and UAV platforms, would have a wide applicability in different areas.},

abstract = {Crop condition and natural vegetation monitoring require high resolution remote sensing imagery in both time and space - a requirement that cannot currently be satisfied by any single Earth observing sensor in isolation. The suite of available remote sensing instruments varies widely in terms of sensor characteristics, spatial resolution and acquisition frequency. For example, the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides daily global observations at 250m to 1km spatial resolution. While imagery from coarse resolution sensors such as MODIS are typically superior to finer resolution data in terms of their revisit frequency, they lack spatial detail to capture surface features for many applications. The Landsat satellite series provides medium spatial resolution (30m) imagery which is well suited to capturing surface details, but a long revisit cycle (16-day) has limited its use in describing daily surface changes. Data fusion approaches provide an alternative way to utilize observations from multiple sensors so that the fused results can provide higher value than can an individual sensor alone. In this paper, we review the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) and two extended data fusion models (STAARCH and ESTARFM) that have been used to fuse MODIS and Landsat data. The fused MODISLandsat results inherit the spatial details of Landsat (30 m) and the temporal revisit frequency of MODIS (daily). The theoretical basis of the fusion approach is described and recent applications are presented. While these approaches can produce imagery with high spatiotemporal resolution, they still rely on the availability of actual satellite images and the quality of ingested remote sensing products. As a result, data fusion is useful for bridging gaps between medium resolution image acquisitions, but cannot replace actual satellite missions.},

abstract = {We used high-frequency in situ measurements of nitrate (NO {\{}3) and dissolved oxygen (DO) from the spring-fed Ichetucknee River, Florida, to derive multiple independent estimates of assimilatory nitrogen (N) demand, and to evaluate the short-term dependence of heterotrophic assimilation and dissimilation (e.g., denitrification) on gross primary productivity (GPP). Autotrophic N assimilation estimates derived from diel DO variability and GPP stoichiometry agreed closely with estimates based on integration of diel variation in NO3- concentration, although the correspondence of these metrics depended on the method used to estimate NO3- baselines. In addition, day-to-day changes in nocturnal NO3- concentration maxima were strongly negatively correlated with day-to-day changes in GPP. Diel temperature variation in the Ichetucknee River indicated that this pattern could not be explained by hydrologic dispersion, while relationships between N assimilation and O-2 production at hourly intervals indicated minimal physiological lags. The estimated magnitude of heterotrophic assimilation was small, indicating that the relationship between changes in GPP and changes in nocturnal NO3- maxima reflects sensitivity of denitrification to variation in exudation of labile organic matter by primary producers. We estimate that similar to 35{\%} of denitrification may be fueled by the previous day's photosynthesis; this result is consistent with the broader hypothesis that the magnitude of autochthonous production in aquatic systems influences the fate of N via both direct and indirect mechanisms.}},

abstract = {Knowledge of headwater influences on the water-quality and flow conditions of downstream waters is essential to water-resource management at all governmental levels; this includes recent court decisions on the jurisdiction of the Federal Clean Water Act (CWA) over upland areas that contribute to larger downstream water bodies. We review current watershed research and use a water-quality model to investigate headwater influences on downstream receiving waters. Our evaluations demonstrate the intrinsic connections of headwaters to landscape processes and downstream waters through their influence on the supply, transport, and fate of water and solutes in watersheds. Hydrological processes in headwater catchments control the recharge of subsurface water stores, flow paths, and residence times of water throughout landscapes. The dynamic coupling of hydrological and biogeochemical processes in upland streams further controls the chemical form, timing, and longitudinal distances of solute transport to downstream waters. We apply the spatially explicit, mass-balance watershed model SPARROW to consider transport and transformations of water and nutrients throughout stream networks in the northeastern United States. We simulate fluxes of nitrogen, a primary nutrient that is a water-quality concern for acidification of streams and lakes and eutrophication of coastal waters, and refine the model structure to include literature observations of nitrogen removal in streams and lakes. We quantify nitrogen transport from headwaters to downstream navigable waters, where headwaters are defined within the model as first-order, perennial streams that include flow and nitrogen contributions from smaller, intermittent and ephemeral streams. We find that first-order headwaters contribute approximately 70{\%} of the mean-annual water volume and 65{\%} of the nitrogen flux in second-order streams. Their contributions to mean water volume and nitrogen flux decline only marginally to about 55{\%} and 40{\%} in fourth- and higher-order rivers that include navigable waters and their tributaries. These results underscore the profound influence that headwater areas have on shaping downstream water quantity and water quality. The results have relevance to water-resource management and regulatory decisions and potentially broaden understanding of the spatial extent of Federal CWA jurisdiction in U.S. waters. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Water Resources Association.},

abstract = {Critical zone influences on hydrologic partitioning, subsurface flow paths and reactions along these flow paths dictate the timing and magnitude of groundwater and solute flux to streams. To isolate first-order controls on seasonal streamflow generation within highly heterogeneous, snow-dominated basins of the Colorado River, we employ a multivariate statistical approach of end-member mixing analysis using a suite of daily chemical and isotopic observations. Mixing models are developed across 11 nested basins (0.4 to 85 km2) spanning a gradient of climatological, physical, and geological characteristics. Hydrograph separation using rain, snow, and groundwater as end-members indicates that seasonal contributions of groundwater to streams is significant. Mean annual groundwater flux ranges from 12{\%} to 33{\%} whereas maximum groundwater contributions of 17{\%} to 50{\%} occur during baseflow. The direct relationship between snow water equivalent and groundwater flux to streams is scale dependent with a trend toward self-similarity when basins exceed 5.5 km2. We find groundwater recharge increases in basins of high relief and within the upper subalpine where maximum snow accumulation is coincident with reduced conifer cover and lower canopy densities. The mixing model developed for the furthest downstream site did not transfer to upstream basins. The resulting error in predicted stream concentrations points toward weathering reactions as a function of source rock and seasonal shifts in flow path. Additionally, the potential for microbial sulfate reduction in floodplain sediments along a low-gradient, meandering portion of the river is sufficient to modify hillslope contributions and alter mixing ratios in the analysis. Soil flushing in response to snowmelt is not included as an end-member but is identified as an important mechanism for release of solutes from these mountainous watersheds. End-member mixing analysis used in combination with high-frequency observations reveals important aspects of catchment hydrodynamics across scale.},

The intensity of reutilization of nutrients as they pass downstream can be quantified in terms of the length of stream required for a nutrient atom to complete one (abstract) cycle ("spiralling length'). A model for steady-state spiralling of a limiting nutrient predicts that most of the downstream transport of nutrient occurs in particulate or unavailable form when nutrient limitation is severe; transportability of particulates is a major determinant of spiralling length. When nutrient limitation is moderated by density-dependent mechanisms, however, transport in the dissolved phase dominates, and transportability of particles has little influence on spiralling length. Functional processes of invertebrate grazing and filter feeding are most likely to shorten spiralling length when nutrient limitation is severe; shredding is more likely to shorten spiralling length when nutrient limitation is weak. -from Authors},

abstract = {A hydrological forecasting model is presented that attempts to combine the important distributed effects of channel network topology and dynamic contributing areas with the advantages of simple lumped parameter basin models. Quick response flow is predicted from a storage/contributing area relationship derived analytically from the topographic structure of a unit within a basin. Average soil water response is represented by a constant leakage infiltration store and an exponential subsurface water store. A simple non-linear routing procedure related to the link frequency distribution of the channel network completes the model and allows distinct basin sub-units, such as headwater and sideslope areas to be modelled separately. The model parameters are physically based in the sense that they may be determined directly by measurement and the model may be used at ungauged sites. Procedures for applying the model and tests with data from the Crimple Beck basin are described. Using only measured and estimated parameter values, without optimization, the model makes satisfactory predictions of basin response. The modular form of the model structure should allow application over a range of small and medium sized basins while retaining the possibility of including more complex model components when suitable data are available. {\textcopyright} 1979 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Interactions between multiple disturbances are of special concern in ecology due to their potential for non-linear behavior and long-lasting legacies on landscape structure and function. If multiple disturbances overcome the ecological resilience of a system, alternate stable states are possible. Increases in the frequency and severity of disturbance events as a result of climate change heighten this concern. This study directly addresses the question of ecosystem resilience in the face of multiple disturbances. We investigated a gradient of disturbance interaction severities between two events in a subalpine forest, a 1997 windstorm (variable severity) and a 2002 wildfire (high-severity). A third disturbance, salvage logging of blowdown (19992001) prior to the fire, served as a de facto experimental treatment. Ninety- nine study plots were established across the disturbance gradient, including fire-only areas for a baseline fire response. Modeling indicated that the combination of two severe disturbances created novel conditions which exceeded the resilience mechanisms of the system. Modeled mean fire residence time and temperature (First Order Fire Effects Model, FOFEM), as well as mean distance to potential seed sources, increased as a result of the interaction. Regeneration 8 years post-fire was essentially absent in medium- to high-severity blowdown þ fire plots, whereas low-severity blowdown þ fire and fire-only areas showed strong regeneration. Blowdown þ salvage þ fire had significantly higher regeneration than areas of comparable blowdown, suggesting that fuel loading drove the interaction. CART analysis supported this hypothesis. Multiple disturbances have the potential to create surprising situations and reduce the resilience of an ecosystem. Differential recovery as a result of a novel disturbance created by compounding events will likely have long lasting legacies across the landscape.},

abstract = {The "critical zone" includes the coupled earth surface systems of vegetation, regolith and groundwater that are essential to sustaining life on the planet. The function of this zone is the result of complex interactions among physical, chemical and biological processes and understanding these interactions remains a major challenge to earth system sciences. Here we develop an integrated framework based on thermodynamic theory to characterize the critical zone as a system open to energy and mass fluxes that are forced by radiant, geochemical, and elevational gradients. We derive a statement that demonstrates the relative importance of solar radiation, water, carbon, and physical/chemical denudation mass fluxes to the critical zone energy balance. Within this framework we use rates of effective energy and mass transfer [EEMT; W m-2] to quantify the relevant flux-gradient relations. Synthesis of existing data demonstrates that variation in energetics associated with primary production and effective precipitation explains substantial variance in critical zone structure and function. Furthermore, we observe threshold behavior in systems that transition to primary production predominance of the energy flux term. The proposed framework provides a first order approximation of non-linearity in critical zone processes that may be coupled with physical and numerical models to constrain landscape evolution. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

The wavelength of the red edge position of the reflectance spectrum correlated very closely with the reflectance at 550 and 700 nm. The ratios of reflectances in the near infra-red range of the spectrum (about 750 nm) to that of 700 RNIR/R550and RNIR/R550were directly proportional to the leaves' chlorophyll concentration.

abstract = {Real-time, continuous, in situ water quality sensors were deployed on a fourth-order Iowa (U.S.) stream draining an agricultural watershed to evaluate key in-stream processes affecting concentrations of nitrate during a 24-day late summer (Aug-Sep) period. Overall, nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations declined 0.11 mg L−1 km−1, or about 1.9{\%} km−1 and 35{\%} in total across 18 km. We also calculated stream metabolic rates using in situ dissolved oxygen data and determined stream biotic N demand to be 108-117 mg m−2 day−1. From this, we estimate that 11{\%} of the NO3-N concentration decline measured between two in-situ sensors separated by 2 km was a result of biotic NO3-N demand, while groundwater NO3-N data and estimates of groundwater flow contributions indicate that dilution was responsible for 53{\%}. Because the concentration decline extends linearly across the entire 18 km of stream length, these processes seem consistent throughout the basin downstream of the most upstream sensor site. The nitrate-dissolved oxygen relationship between the two sites separated by 2 km, calculations of biotic NO3-N demand, and diurnal variations in NO3-N concentration all indicate that denitrification by anaerobes is removing less NO3-N than that assimilated by aquatic organisms unable to fix nitrogen for their life processes, and thus the large majority of the NO3-N entering this stream is not retained or removed, but rather transported downstream.

abstract = {[1] Over the past 3 decades, nutrient spiraling has become a unifying paradigm for stream biogeochemical research. This paper presents ( 1) a quantitative synthesis of the nutrient spiraling literature and ( 2) application of these data to elucidate trends in nutrient spiraling within stream networks. Results are based on 404 individual experiments on ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NO3), and phosphate (PO4) from 52 published studies. Sixty-nine percent of the experiments were performed in first- and second-order streams, and 31{\%} were performed in third- to fifth-order streams. Uptake lengths, S-w, of NH4 (median = 86 m) and PO4 (median = 96 m) were significantly different (alpha = 0.05) than NO3 (median = 236 m). Areal uptake rates of NH4 (median = 28 mu g m(-2) min(-1)) were significantly different than NO3 and PO4 (median = 15 and 14 mu g m(-2) min(-1), respectively). There were significant differences among NH4, NO3, and PO4 uptake velocity (median = 5, 1, and 2 mm min(-1), respectively). Correlation analysis results were equivocal on the effect of transient storage on nutrient spiraling. Application of these data to a stream network model showed that recycling (defined here as stream length divided by S-w) of NH4 and NO3 generally increased with stream order, while PO4 recycling remained constant along a first- to fifth-order stream gradient. Within this hypothetical stream network, cumulative NH4 uptake decreased slightly with stream order, while cumulative NO3 and PO4 uptake increased with stream order. These data suggest the importance of larger rivers to nutrient spiraling and the need to consider how stream networks affect nutrient flux between terrestrial and marine ecosystems.},

abstract = {River corridors play a crucial environmental, economic, and societal role yet also represent one of the world's most dangerous natural hazards, making monitoring imperative to improve our understanding and to protect people. Remote sensing offers a rapidly growing suite of methods by which river corridor monitoring can be performed efficiently, at a range of scales and in difficult environmental conditions. This paper aims to evaluate the current state and assess the potential future of river corridor monitoring, whilst highlighting areas that require further investigation. We initially review established methods that are used to undertake river corridor monitoring, framed by the context and scales upon which they are applied. Subsequently, we review cutting edge technologies that are being developed and focussed around unmanned aerial vehicle and multisensor system advances. We also “horizon scan” for future methods that may become increasingly prominent in research and management, citing examples from within and outside of the fluvial domain. Through review of the literature, it has become apparent that the main gap in fluvial remote sensing lies in the trade-off between resolution and scales. However, prioritising process measurements and simultaneous multisensor data collection is likely to offer a bigger advance in understanding than purely from better surveying methods alone. Challenges regarding the legal deployment of more complex systems, as well as effectively disseminating data into the science community, are amongst those that we propose need addressing. However, the plethora of methods currently available means that researchers and monitoring agencies will be able to identify suitable techniques for their needs.},

abstract = {1. Ecological stoichiometry deals with the mass balance of multiple key elements [e.g. carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P)] in ecological systems. This conceptual framework, largely developed in the pelagic zone of lakes, has been successfully applied to topics ranging from population dynamics to biogeochemical cycling. More recently, an explicit stoichiometric approach has also been used in many other environments, including freshwater benthic ecosystems. 2. Description of elemental patterns among benthic resources and consumers provides a useful starting point for understanding causes of variation and stoichiometric imbalance in feeding interactions. Although there is considerable overlap among categories, terrestrially-derived resources, such as wood, leaf litter and green leaves have substantially higher C : nutrient ratios than other resources of both terrestrial and aquatic origin, such as periphyton and fine particulate organic matter. The elemental composition of these resources for benthic consumers is modulated by a range of factors and processes, including nutrient availability and ratios, particle size and microbial colonisation. 3. Among consumers in benthic systems, bacteria are the most nutrient-rich, followed (in descending order) by fishes, invertebrate predators, invertebrate primary consumers, and fungi. Differences in consumer C : nutrient ratios appear to be related to broad-scale phylogenetic differences which determine body size, growth rate and resource allocation to structural body constituents (e.g. P-rich bone). 4. Benthic consumers can influence the stoichiometry of dissolved nutrients and basal resources in multiple ways. Direct consumption alters the stoichiometry of food resources by increasing nutrient availability (e.g. reduced boundary layer thickness on substrata) or through removal of nutrient-rich patches (e.g. selective feeding on fungal patches within leaf litter). In addition, consumers alter the stoichiometry of resources and dissolved nutrient pools through the return of egested or excreted nutrients. In some cases, consumer excretion supplies a large proportion of the nutrients required by algae and heterotrophic microbes and alters elemental ratios of dissolved nutrient pools. 5. Organic matter decomposition in benthic systems is accompanied by significant changes in the elemental composition of organic matter. Microbial colonisation of leaf litter influences C : nutrient ratios, and patterns of microbial succession (e.g. fungi followed by bacteria) may be under some degree of stoichiometric control. Large elemental imbalances exist between particulate organic matter and detritivores, which is likely to constrain growth rates and invertebrate secondary production. Such imbalances may therefore select for behavioural and other strategies for dealing with them. Comminution of large particles by benthic consumers alters detrital C : nutrient ratios and can influence the stoichiometry of elemental export from whole catchments. 6. A stoichiometric framework is likely to advance understanding of biogeochemical cycling in benthic ecosystems. A set of scenarios is developed that explores the influence of microbial elemental composition on nutrient spiralling parameters in streams, such as uptake length and uptake rate ratios. The presented hypothetical examples identify when the elemental composition of benthic stream organisms is likely to predict nutrient uptake ratios and conditions that would cause benthic stoichiometry and nutrient uptake from the water column to become uncoupled. {\textcopyright} 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {During an experimental study of runoff producing mechanisms in a small drainage basin, the major portion of storm runoff was produced as overland flow on a small proportion of the watershed. Where the water table intersected the ground surface before and during a storm, water escaped from the soil surface and ran quickly to the stream at velocities 100 to 500 times those of the subsurface system. Direct precipitation onto the saturated area was another major contributor of storm flow. Storage of water within these source areas was small and travel times out of them were short. Runoff from them was largely controlled by rainfall intensity. These partial areas contributing quick runoff could expand or contract seasonally or during a storm. Their position and expansion can be related to geology, topography, soils, and rainfall characteristics. In the study basin, water that remained below the ground surface on its way to the main stream channel was a relatively minor contributor to the storm hydrograph. The response of subsurface flow to rainfall was heavily damped by storage and transmission within the soil. Measurements of water table elevation and runoff from experimental plots in another small watershed with different geologic conditions confirmed the results outlined above. Runoff records from a large number of small basins of the Sleepers River experimental watershed indicate the more general applicability of these findings.

abstract = {Nutrient fluxes were investigated on a forested and a clearcut plot in a mixed conifer high elevation (2900 m) forest at the Fraser Experimental Forest in Fraser, Colorado, USA. Plots were located on a coarse loamy mixed Dystric Cryochrept with relatively high base saturation (30-90{\%}) and underlain by an impermeable clay subsoil. Following harvest in late 1984, annual mean NO3 concentrations of 195 to 198 mu mol l(-1) were observed from 1988 through 1990 and concentrations were still above reference levels in 1993. Total nitrogen loss attributable to leaching following harvest was estimated at 48kg ha(-1) over 8 years. Over this same period, atmospheric nitrogen inputs exceeded annual outflow of NH4 plus NO3 from the control plots by approximately 11 kg N ha(-1). A slight enrichment of SO4 and Cl was observed from the harvested plot in 1986 but concentrations later fell below control plot levels, apparently due to dilution by the increased discharge from the harvested plot which was three to four times that from the control plot. Elevated Ca, Mg, and Na concentrations followed a similar pattern to NO3 due to exchange reactions, while a depression in alkalinity of about one-third the amount of NO3 found was also observed. Enrichment of K occurred primarily in water collected at less than 1 m depth. Increases in base cation loss due to leaching after harvest were about twice the amount that can be accounted for by the increased flux of NO3, SO4, and Cl anions. The excess reflects the increased water flux and consequent leaching of base cations in association with HCO3 and organic anions.},

abstract = {We examined the effect of agricultural land use on whole-stream nutrient availability, biofilm standing crop, and biofilm nutrient limitation and uptake in 21 stream locations in southeastern Idaho. Higher stream water concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), but not nitrate (NO3-N) or phosphate (PO4-P), were associated with {\%} agriculture in the watershed. Streambed chlorophyll a (Chl a) and ash free dry weight (AF dry wt) also increased with agricultural land use. Nutrient diffusing substrate (NDS) bioassays, which determine biofilm nutrient limitation, showed that Chl a was NO3-N limited and suppressed by labile DOC, whereas AF dry wt did not respond to either NO3-N or labile DOC additions. Together, the different responses of Chl a and AF dry wt suggest potential competition between biofilm autotrophs and heterotrophs for nutrients or other resources. Nutrient uptake, determined with short-term releases of NO3-N, PO4-P, and DOC (as glucose) showed that NO3-N uptake velocity (Vf) increased with agricultural land use. Despite the N-limited status of biofilms indicated by the NDS results, uptake of NO3-N could not be consistently detected at all locations. The differences in response of biofilm to organic carbon enrichment suggests a difference in DOC quality, with labile DOC added with NDS compared to perhaps less-labile DOC found in-stream. Linking the interactive responses of biofilm communities to altered nutrient availability is an important step toward understanding whole ecosystem responses to land-use change.},

abstract = {In January 2001, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers exceeded its statutory authority by asserting Clean Water Act (CWA) jurisdiction over non-navigable, isolated, intrastate waters based solely on their use by migratory birds. The Supreme Court's majority opinion addressed broader issues of CWA jurisdiction by implying that the CWA intended some "connection" to navigability and that isolated waters need a "significant nexus" to navigable waters to be jurisdictional. Subsequent to this decision (SWANCC), there have been many lawsuits challenging CWA jurisdiction, many of which are focused on headwater, intermittent, and ephemeral streams. To inform the legal and policy debate surrounding this issue, we present information on the geographic distribution of headwater streams and intermittent and ephemeral streams throughout the U.S., summarize major findings from the scientific literature in considering hydrological connectivity between headwater streams and downstream waters, and relate the scientific information presented to policy issues surrounding the scope of waters protected under the CWA. Headwater streams comprise approximately 53{\%} (2,900,000 km) of the total stream length in the U.S., excluding Alaska, and intermittent and ephemeral streams comprise approximately 59{\%} (3,200,000 km) of the total stream length and approximately 50{\%} (1,460,000 km) of the headwater stream length in the U.S., excluding Alaska. Hillslopes, headwater streams, and downstream waters are best described as individual elements of integrated hydrological systems. Hydrological connectivity allows for the exchange of mass, momentum, energy, and organisms longitudinally, laterally, vertically, and temporally between headwater streams and downstream waters. Via hydrological connectivity, headwater, intermittent and ephemeral streams cumulatively contribute to the functional integrity of downstream waters; hydrologically and ecologically, they are a part of the tributary system. As this debate continues, scientific input from multiple fields will be important for policymaking at the federal, state, and local levels and to inform water resource management regardless of the level at which those decisions are being made. Strengthening the interface between science, policy, and public participation is critical if we are going to achieve effective water resource management. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Water Resources Association.},

abstract = {1. Ecological stoichiometry deals with the mass balance of multiple key elements [e.g. carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P)] in ecological systems. This conceptual framework, largely developed in the pelagic zone of lakes, has been successfully applied to topics ranging from population dynamics to biogeochemical cycling. More recently, an explicit stoichiometric approach has also been used in many other environments, including freshwater benthic ecosystems. 2. Description of elemental patterns among benthic resources and consumers provides a useful starting point for understanding causes of variation and stoichiometric imbalance in feeding interactions. Although there is considerable overlap among categories, terrestrially-derived resources, such as wood, leaf litter and green leaves have substantially higher C : nutrient ratios than other resources of both terrestrial and aquatic origin, such as periphyton and fine particulate organic matter. The elemental composition of these resources for benthic consumers is modulated by a range of factors and processes, including nutrient availability and ratios, particle size and microbial colonisation. 3. Among consumers in benthic systems, bacteria are the most nutrient-rich, followed (in descending order) by fishes, invertebrate predators, invertebrate primary consumers, and fungi. Differences in consumer C : nutrient ratios appear to be related to broad-scale phylogenetic differences which determine body size, growth rate and resource allocation to structural body constituents (e.g. P-rich bone). 4. Benthic consumers can influence the stoichiometry of dissolved nutrients and basal resources in multiple ways. Direct consumption alters the stoichiometry of food resources by increasing nutrient availability (e.g. reduced boundary layer thickness on substrata) or through removal of nutrient-rich patches (e.g. selective feeding on fungal patches within leaf litter). In addition, consumers alter the stoichiometry of resources and dissolved nutrient pools through the return of egested or excreted nutrients. In some cases, consumer excretion supplies a large proportion of the nutrients required by algae and heterotrophic microbes and alters elemental ratios of dissolved nutrient pools. 5. Organic matter decomposition in benthic systems is accompanied by significant changes in the elemental composition of organic matter. Microbial colonisation of leaf litter influences C : nutrient ratios, and patterns of microbial succession (e.g. fungi followed by bacteria) may be under some degree of stoichiometric control. Large elemental imbalances exist between particulate organic matter and detritivores, which is likely to constrain growth rates and invertebrate secondary production. Such imbalances may therefore select for behavioural and other strategies for dealing with them. Comminution of large particles by benthic consumers alters detrital C : nutrient ratios and can influence the stoichiometry of elemental export from whole catchments. 6. A stoichiometric framework is likely to advance understanding of biogeochemical cycling in benthic ecosystems. A set of scenarios is developed that explores the influence of microbial elemental composition on nutrient spiralling parameters in streams, such as uptake length and uptake rate ratios. The presented hypothetical examples identify when the elemental composition of benthic stream organisms is likely to predict nutrient uptake ratios and conditions that would cause benthic stoichiometry and nutrient uptake from the water column to become uncoupled. {\textcopyright} 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors Limnology and Oceanography published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography Carbon fixation and respiration in flowing waterways play significant roles in global and regional carbon budgets, yet how land use and watershed management interact with temporal disturbances (storms) to influence metabolism remains poorly understood. Here, we combine long-term with synoptic sampling of metabolism and its variable controls in neighboring watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay to resolve limiting factors and critical timescales associated with recovery from disturbance. We found that, relative to predictions of the river continuum concept, focal streams have “disrupted” carbon cycles, with carbon balances closer to zero, and, in some cases, tighter coupling between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), attributable to carbon limitation. Carbon became limiting to ER where flashy storm hydrographs and simplified channel geomorphology inhibited accumulation of fine sediment. Shannon entropy analysis of timescales revealed that fine sediment served as a time-release capsule for nutrients and carbon over 4–6 months, fueling biogeochemical transformations. Loss of fines through hydraulic disturbance had up to 30-d impacts on GPP and 50-d impacts on ER in the stream with carbon limitation. In contrast, where GPP and ER were not tightly coupled, recovery occurred within 1 d. Results suggest that a complex interplay between nutrient and carbon limitation and mechanical and chemical disturbance governs patterns and consequences of disrupted carbon cycling in urban streams. Carbon limitation and tight GPP/ER coupling enhance the vulnerability of stream ecosystem functions, but best management practices that target stormflow reduction and channel geomorphic diversity can break that coupling and minimize carbon cycle disruptions.},

abstract = {Remote detection and mapping of hydrocarbons (PHCs) in situ in continental areas is still an operational challenge due to the small scale of the occurrences and the mix of spectral signatures of PHCs and mineral substrates in imagery pixels. Despite the increasing development of new technologies, the use of hyperspectral remote sensing data as a complementary tool for both oil exploration and environmental monitoring is not standard in the oil industry, despite its potential. The high spectral resolution of hyperspectral images allows the direct identification of PHCs on the surface and provides valuable information regarding the location and spread of oil spills that can assist in containment and cleanup operations. Combining the spectral information with statistical techniques also offers the potential to improve exploration programs focused on the discovery of new exploration fields through the qualitative and quantitative characterization of oil occurrences in onshore areas. In this scenario, the aim of this work was to develop methods that can assist the detection of continental areas affected by natural oil seeps or leaks (crude oils and fuels). A field experiment was designed by impregnating several mineral substrates with crude oils and fuels in varying concentrations. Simultaneous measurements of soil-PHC combinations were taken using both a hand-held spectrometer and an airborne hyperspectral imager. Classification algorithms were used to directly map the PHCs on the surface. Spectral information was submitted to a PLS (partial least square regression) to create a prediction model for the estimation of the concentrations of PHCs in soils. The developed model was able to detect three impregnation levels (low, intermediate, high), predicting values close to the concentrations used in the experiment. Given the quality of the results in controlled experiments, the methods developed in this research show the potential to support the oil industry in the discovery of new oil plays and reservoirs and to define the contamination stage and spread of oil/fuel in areas affected by accidental leaks, improving both exploration and environmental monitoring.},

Thus, the path traveled by a nutrient atom in passing through the cycle can be visualized as a spiral. As an index of the spiralling process, we introduce spiralling length, defined as the average distance associated with one complete cycle of a nutrient atom. This index provides a measure of the utilization of nutrients relative to the available supply from upstream.

abstract = {To investigate the coupling between carbon (C) and phosphorus (P) cycling in a human-altered stream, we conducted a whole-ecosystem manipulation of the labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool in a nitrate (NO-3)-rich stream in the midwestern United States. For 6 d, we increased stream DOC by {\~{}} 1 mg L-1 through a continuous addition of sodium acetate. On the sixth day of the addition, ammonium (NH+4) was increased by {\~{}} 130 $\mu$g N L-1 to examine the potential for nitrogen (N) to mediate coupled C and P cycling. Of the added DOC, 85{\%} was retained within the treatment reach, which increased ecosystem respiration with respect to the reference reach. Alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) increased from day 1 to day 6; however, water column P uptake only increased on day 6 concurrent with the NH+4 addition. Gross primary production decreased during the DOC addition relative to the reference reach, yet seemed to recover on day 6 (NH+4 addition). These results suggest that during the DOC addition, heterotrophs out-competed autotrophs for N and that sediment-sorbed P sustained the heterotrophic community while P uptake from the water column was dominated by autotrophs. Because APA and P uptake were stimulated by the simultaneous DOC and NH+4 addition, P cycling appeared to be N limited, despite the high ambient NO-3 concentration; this indicates a strong preferential uptake of NH4 over NO+4: In streams, C and P cycling can be intrinsically coupled through biological mechanisms, and this coupling can be mediated by the availability of different forms of inorganic N. {\textcopyright} 2013, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

How strongly denitrification affects the transport of nitrate (NO(3)-N) in Illinois streams has not been directly assessed. We used the nutrient spiraling model to assess the role of in-stream denitrification in affecting the concentration and downstream transport of NO(3)-N in five headwater streams in agricultural areas of east-central Illinois. Denitrification in stream sediments was measured approximately monthly from April 2001 through January 2002. Denitrification rates tended to be high (up to 15 mg N m(-2) h(-1)), but the concentration of NO(3)-N in the streams was also high ({\textgreater}7 mg N L(-1)). Uptake velocities for NO(3)-N (uptake rate/concentration) were lower than reported for undisturbed streams, indicating that denitrification was not an efficient N sink relative to the concentration of NO(3)-N in the water column. Denitrification uptake lengths (the average distance NO(3)-N travels before being denitrified) were long and indicated that denitrification in the streambed did not affect the transport of NO(3)-N. Loss rates for NO(3)-N in the streams were {\textless}5{\%} d(-1) except during periods of low discharge and low NO(3)-N concentration, which occurred only in late summer and early autumn. Annually, most NO(3)-N in these headwater sites appeared to be exported to downstream water bodies rather than denitrified, suggesting previous estimates of N losses through in-stream denitrification may have been overestimated.},

abstract = {Temperature and nutrient availability play key roles in controlling the pathways and rates at which energy and materials move through ecosystems. These factors have also changed dramatically on Earth over the past century as human activities have intensified. Although significant effort has been devoted to understanding the role of temperature and nutrients in isolation, less is known about how these two factors interact to influence ecological processes. Recent advances in ecological stoichiometry and metabolic ecology provide a useful framework for making progress in this area, but conceptual synthesis and review are needed to help catalyze additional research. Here, we examine known and potential interactions between temperature and nutrients from a variety of physiological, community, and ecosystem perspectives. We first review patterns at the level of the individual, focusing on four traits – growth, respiration, body size, and elemental content – that should theoretically govern how temperature and nutrients interact to influence higher levels of biological organization. We next explore the interactive effects of temperature and nutrients on populations, communities, and food webs by synthesizing information related to community size spectra, biomass distributions, and elemental composition. We use metabolic theory to make predictions about how population-level secondary production should respond to interactions between temperature and resource supply, setting up qualitative predictions about the flows of energy and materials through metazoan food webs. Last, we examine how temperature–nutrient interactions influence processes at the whole-ecosystem level, focusing on apparent vs. intrinsic activation energies of ecosystem processes, how to represent temperature–nutrient interactions in ecosystem models, and patterns with respect to nutrient uptake and organic matter decomposition. We conclude that a better understanding of interactions between temperature and nutrients will be critical for developing realistic predictions about ecological responses to multiple, simultaneous drivers of global change, including climate warming and elevated nutrient supply.},

abstract = {Streamflow generation in boreal catchments remains poorly understood. This is especially true for snowmelt episodes, which are the dominant hydrological event in many seasonally snow covered regions. We examined the spatial and temporal aspects of flow pathways by linking detailed oxygen 18 observations of stream, melt, soil, and groundwater with hydrometric measurements in a small catchment in northern Sweden during the snowmelt period. The results demonstrate that soil horizons below 90 cm were hardly affected by the approximately 200 mm of snowmelt water infiltrating into the soil during the spring. The approximately sixtyfold increase in runoff, from 0.13 mm d-1 to 8 mm d-1, was generated by a 30-40 cm rise of the groundwater level. The total runoff during the snowmelt period from late April to late May was 134 mm, of which 75{\%} was preevent water. Mass balance calculations based on hydrometric and isotopic data independently, both using upscaling of a hillslope transect to the entire 13-ha catchment, provided similar results of both water storage changes and the amount of event water that was left in the catchment after the snowmelt. In general, groundwater levels and runoff were strongly correlated, but different functional relationships were observed for frozen and unfrozen soil conditions. Although runoff generation in the catchment generally could be explained by the transmissivity feedback concept, the results suggest that there is a temporal variability in the flow pathways during the spring controlled by soil frost during early snowmelt.},

Unlike the abrupt biogeochemical changes typical after wildfire and timber harvesting, the outcomes of insect outbreaks are poorly understood. The mountain pine bark beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) began to attack lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) at the Fraser Experimental Forest in 2002 and spread throughout the research area by 2007. We compared streamwater nitrogen (N) from 2003 through 2012 with data from the previous two decades in four watersheds with distinct forest management histories, stand structures, and responses to the beetle outbreak. Watersheds dominated by old-growth had larger trees and lost 85{\%} of overstory pine and 44{\%} of total basal area to bark beetles. In contrast, managed watersheds containing a mixture of second-growth (30–60 year old) and old-growth (250- to 350-year old) had higher density of subcanopy trees, smaller mean tree diameter, and lower bark beetle-induced mortality ({\~{}}26{\%} of total basal area). Streamwater nitrate concentrations were significantly higher in old-growth watersheds during the outbreak than pre-outbreak levels during snowmelt and base flow seasons. In mixed-age stands, streamwater nitrate concentrations were unaffected by the outbreak. Beetle outbreak elevated inorganic N export 43 and 74{\%} in two old-growth watersheds though the amounts of N released in streamwater were low (0.04 and 0.15 kg N ha−1) relative to atmospheric inputs ({\textless}2{\%} of annual N deposition). Increased height, diameter, and foliar N of measured in residual live trees augmented demand for N, far in excess of the change in N export during the outbreak. Reallocation of soil resources released after pine mortality to overstory and understory vegetation helps explain high nutrient retention in watersheds affected by bark beetle outbreaks.},

abstract = {One of the most important functions of catchments is the storage of water. Catchment storage buffers meteorological extremes and interannual streamflow variability, controls the partitioning between evaporation and runoff, and influences transit times of water. Hydrogeological data to estimate storage are usually scarce and seldom available for a larger set of catchments. This study focused on storage in prealpine and alpine catchments, using a set of 21 Swiss catchments comprising different elevation ranges. Catchment storage comparisons depend on storage definitions. This study defines different types of storage including definitions of dynamic and mobile catchment storage. We then estimated dynamic storage using four methods, water balance analysis, streamflow recession analysis, calibration of a bucket-type hydrological model Hydrologiska Byr{\aa}ns Vattenbalansavdelning model (HBV), and calibration of a transfer function hydrograph separation model using stable isotope observations. The HBV model allowed quantifying the contributions of snow, soil and groundwater storages compared to the dynamic catchment storage. With the transfer function hydrograph separation model both dynamic and mobile storage was estimated. Dynamic storage of one catchment estimated by the four methods differed up to one order of magnitude. Nevertheless, the storage estimates ranked similarly among the 21 catchments. The largest dynamic and mobile storage estimates were found in high-elevation catchments. Besides snow, groundwater contributed considerably to this larger storage. Generally, we found that with increasing elevation the relative contribution to the dynamic catchment storage increased for snow, decreased for soil, but remained similar for groundwater storage.},

For detection of vegetation changes, temporal images are usually independently analyzed or vegetation index differencing is implemented. In this study, a vegetation change index, named normalized difference vegetation change index (NDVCI), was developed to directly detect vegetation changes between two different time images with improved accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method to detect vegetation changes was evaluated in comparison with that of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) differencing and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) differencing methods at seven test sites under different environmental conditions in Iran, Malaysia, and Italy. Landsat imagery as one of the most widely used sources of data in remote sensing was used for this purpose. Overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, and omission and commission errors were calculated to assess the accuracy of the resulting change maps. The results demonstrated superiority and higher performance of NDVCI compared to EVI and NDVI differencing for detection of vegetation changes. In five out of the seven test sites, the classification accuracy of NDVCI was higher compared to that of the other methods. In contrast, the results revealed lower accuracy of EVI differencing for vegetation change detection at all the test sites, while NDVI differencing was superior at two of the test sites. In conclusion, the study demonstrated great performance of NDVCI for monitoring vegetation changes at different environmental conditions.

abstract = {Abstract Watersheds are three-dimensional hydrologic systems where the longitudinal expansion/contraction of stream networks, vertical connection/disconnection between shallow and deep groundwater systems, and lateral connectivity of these water sources to streams mediate runoff production and nutrient export. The connectivity of runoff source areas during both baseflow and stormflow conditions and their combined influence on biogeochemical fluxes remain poorly understood. Here we focused on a set of 3.3 and 48.4 ha nested watersheds (North Carolina, USA). These watersheds comprise ephemeral and intermittent runoff-producing headwaters and perennial runoff-producing lowlands. Within these landscape elements, we characterized the timing and magnitude of precipitation, runoff, and runoff-generating flow paths. The active surface drainage network (ASDN) reflected connectivity to, and contributions from, source areas that differed under baseflow and stormflow conditions. The baseflow-associated ASDN expanded and contracted seasonally, driven by the rise and fall of the seasonal water table. Superimposed on this were event-activated source area contributions driven by connectivity to surficial and shallow subsurface flow paths. Frequently activated shallow flow paths also caused increased in-stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations with increases in runoff across both watershed scales. The spread and variability within this DOC-runoff relationship was driven by a seasonal depletion of DOC from continual shallow subsurface flow path activation and subsequent replenishment from autumn litterfall. Our findings suggest that hydrobiogeochemical signals at larger watershed outlets can be driven by the expansion, contraction, and connection of lateral, longitudinal, and vertical source areas with distinct runoff generation processes.},

abstract = {We studied nutrient uptake in relation to water chemistry, stream hydrodynamics, and ecosystem metabolism in two eutrophic lowland streams located near Berlin, Germany. Ambient nutrient uptake rates ranged from 0.180 to 12.880 g NO3-N m-2 d-1, from 0.035 to 0.517 g NH 4-N m-2 d-1, and from 0.017 to 0.750 g PO 4-P m-2 d-1. Temporal and spatial variability in nutrient uptake rates within single streams were mainly controlled by concentrations of metabolic substrates (i.e., nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, and dissolved oxygen) and rates of ecosystem metabolism, highlighting the importance of assimilative nutrient uptake. According to stoichiometric accounts, dissimilative uptake of dissolved inorganic nitrogen was an important uptake mechanism. Thus, nutrient uptake was subject to controls similar to those reported from pristine study sites, indicating that basic patterns of nutrient retention are comparable in pristine and eutrophic streams. In contrast to pristine streams, eutrophic streams exhibited long nutrient uptake lengths (in the range of several kilometers), as elevated uptake rates could only partially compensate for high nutrient loads. Our results indicate that ecosystem nutrient uptake is unable to efficiently reduce nutrient exports from the investigated eutrophic lowland streams. {\textcopyright} 2006, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {Simple nitrogen (N) input/output balance calculations in agricultural systems are used to evaluate performance of nutrient management; however, they generally rely on extensive assumptions that do not consider leaching, denitrification, or annual depletion of soil N. We constructed a relatively complete N mass balance for the Big Ditch watershed, an extensively tile-drained agricultural watershed in east-central Illinois. We conducted direct measurements of a wide range of N pools and fluxes for a 2-yr period, including soil N mineralization, soybean N(2) fixation, tile and river N loads, and ground water and in-stream denitrification. Fertilizer N inputs were from a survey of the watershed and yield data from county estimates that were combined with estimated protein contents to obtain grain N. By using maize fertilizer recovery and soybean N(2) fixation to estimate total grain N derived from soil, we calculated the explicit change in soil N storage each year. Overall, fertilizer N and soybean N(2) fixation dominated inputs, and total grain export dominated outputs. Precipitation during 2001 was below average (78 cm), whereas precipitation in 2002 exceeded the 30-yr average of 97 cm; monthly rainfall was above average in April, May, and June of 2002, which flooded fields and produced large tile and riverine N loads. In 2001, watershed inputs were greater than outputs, suggesting that carryover of N to the subsequent year may occur. In 2002, total inputs were less than outputs due to large leaching losses and likely substantial field denitrification. The explicit change in soil storage (67 kg N ha(-1)) offsets this balance shortfall. Although 2002 was climatically unusual, with current production trends of greater maize grain yields with less fertilizer N, soil N depletion is likely to occur in maize/soybean rotations, especially in years with above-average precipitation or extremely wet spring periods.},

abstract = {To test the transmissivity feedback hypothesis of runoff generation, surface and subsurface waters were monitored and sampled during the 1996 snowmelt at various topographic positions in a 41 ha forested headwater catchment at Sleepers River, Vermont. Two conditions that promote transmissivity feedback existed in the catchment during the melt period. First, saturated hydraulic conductivity increased toward land surface, from a geometric mean of 3.6 mm h-1 in glacial till to 25.6 mm h-1 in deep soil to 54.0 mm h-1 in shallow soil. Second, groundwater levels rose to within 0.3 m of land surface at all riparian sites and most hillslope sites at peak melt. The importance of transmissivity feedback to streamflow generation was tested at the catchment scale by examination of physical and chemical patterns of groundwater in near-stream (discharge) and hillslope (recharge/lateral flow) zones, and within a geomorphic hollow (convergent flow). The presence of transmissivity feedback was supported by the abrupt increase in streamflow as the water table rose into the surficial, transmissive zone; a flattening of the groundwater level vs. streamflow curve occurred at most sites. This relation had a clockwise hysteresis (higher groundwater level for given discharge on rising limb than at same discharge on falling limb) at riparian sites, suggesting that the riparian zone was the dominant source area during the rising limb of the melt hydrograph. Hysteresis was counterclockwise at hillslope sites, suggesting that hillslope drainage controlled the snowmelt recession. End member mixing analysis using Ca, Mg, Na, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and Si showed that stream chemistry could be explained as a two-component mixture of groundwater high in base cations and an O-horizon/overland flow water high in DOC. The dominance of shallow flow paths during events was indicated by the high positive correlation of DOC with streamflow (r2 = 0.82). Despite the occurrence of transmissivity feedback, hillslope till and soil water were ruled out as end members primarily because their distinctive high-Si composition had little or no effect on streamwater composition. Till water from the geomorphic hollow had a chemistry very close to streamwater base flow, and may represent the base flow end member better than the more concentrated riparian groundwater. During snowmelt, streamwater composition shifted as this base flow was diluted - not by shallow groundwater from the hillslope, but rather by a more surficial O-horizon/overland flow water.},

This limits our ability to predict the fluvial carbon flux responses to changes in climate and land‐use. We used DOC concentration and discharge patterns with ensemble modelling techniques to quantify DOC flux behavior for 1006 United States watersheds spanning diverse climate and land cover conditions. We found that DOC flux was transport‐limited (concentration increased with discharge) in 80{\%} of watersheds and that this flux behavior spanned ecoregions and watershed sizes. The generality of transport limitation demonstrates how coupling discharge models with widely available watershed properties could allow DOC flux to be efficiently integrated into landscape and earth system models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Excess nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) from human activities have contributed to degradation of coastal waters globally. A growing body of work suggests that hydrologically restoring streams and rivers in agricultural and urban watersheds has potential to increase N and P retention, but rates and mechanisms have not yet been analyzed and compared across studies. We conducted a review of nutrient retention within hydrologically reconnected streams and rivers, including 79 studies. We developed a typology characterizing different forms of stream and river restoration, and we also analyzed nutrient retention across this typology. The studies we reviewed used a variety of methods to analyze nutrient cycling. We performed a further intensive meta-analysis on nutrient spiraling studies because this method was the most consistent and comparable between studies. A meta-analysis of 240 experimental additions of ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) was synthesized from 15 nutrient spiraling studies. Our results showed statistically significant relationships between nutrient uptake in restored streams and specific watershed attributes. Nitrate uptake metrics were significantly related to watershed surface area, impervious surface cover, and average reach width (p {\textless} 0.05). Ammonium uptake metrics were significantly related to discharge, velocity, and transient storage (p {\textless} 0.05). SRP uptake metrics were significantly related to watershed area, discharge, SRP concentrations, and chl a concentrations (p {\textless} 0.05). Given that most studies were conducted during baseflow, more research is necessary to characterize nutrient uptake during high flow. Furthermore, long-term studies are needed to understand changes in nutrient dynamics as projects evolve over time. Overall analysis suggests the size of the stream restoration (surface area), hydrologic connectivity, and hydrologic residence time are key drivers influencing nutrient retention at broader watershed scales and along the urban watershed continuum.},

abstract = {It is increasingly being recognized that global ecological research requires novel methods and strategies in which to combine process-based ecological models and data in cohesive, systematic ways. In process-based model applications, inherent spatial and temporal heterogeneities found within terrestrial ecosystems may lead to the uncertainties of model predictions. To reduce simulation uncertainties due to inaccurate model parameters, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was applied in this study to improve the estimations of four key parameters used in the process-based ecosystem model of TRIPLEXFLUX. These four key parameters include a maximum photosynthetic carboxylation rate of 25°C (Vmax), an electron transport (Jmax) light-saturated rate within the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle of leaves, a coefficient of stomatal conductance (m), and a reference respiration rate of 10°C (R10). Seven forest flux tower sites located across North America were used to investigate and facilitate understanding of the daily variation in model parameters for three deciduous forests, three evergreen temperate forests, and one evergreen boreal forest. Eddy covariance CO2 exchange measurements were assimilated to optimize the parameters in the year 2006. After parameter optimization and adjustment took place, net ecosystem production prediction significantly improved (by approximately 25{\%}) compared to the CO2 flux measurements taken at the seven forest ecosystem sites. Results suggest that greater seasonal variability occurs in broadleaf forests in respect to the selected parameters than in needleleaf forests. This study also demonstrated that the model-data fusion approach by incorporating MCMC method is able to better estimate parameters and improve simulation accuracy for different ecosystems located across North America.},

abstract = {Effectiveness in geomorphology may be associated with transport (work) and with landform. Bedload transport may relate to both. Determination of that discharge which transports more bedload than any other entails assessment of the magnitude and frequency of bedload transport. This involves arraying daily mean discharges, computing the bedload for each unit of discharge, and determining the discharge that transports the most bedload. For those rivers in which the relationships of bedload discharge to water discharge are not dominated by very large-size particles and where daily mean discharges are an adequate description of streamflow characteristics, a large body of data demonstrates that this discharge is often analogous to bankfull discharge and often has a frequency of recurrence of one to two years. Rivers with constraints on the mobility of bed material, typically armoured channels with steeper than average relationships of bedload discharge to water discharge, may have an effective discharge occurring at higher stages and greater recurrence intervals than bankfull discharge. Bedload discharges were measured at five snow-melt dominated, gravel-bedded rivers in the northern Rocky Mountains, USA; drainage areas at the sites ranged from about 55 to 4950 km2 and bankfull discharges ranged from about 6.5 to 650 m3 s-1. Median bed-surface particles, d50, ranged from 40 to 173 mm, and d90 ranged from 132 to 310 mm. Exponents of the bedload ratings, indicating the steepness of the relationship of bedload discharge to water discharge, ranged from 2{\textperiodcentered}30 to 5{\textperiodcentered}06. Values of the exponent correlated well with values of either d50 or d90 of the bed-surface material and demonstrate the effect of the bed-surface material on the bedload rating. Effective discharge was determined for each site. The ratio of effective discharge to bankfull discharge, Qc/Qb, ranged from 0{\textperiodcentered}98 to 1{\textperiodcentered}31. The values of Qe/Qb correlated well with exponent values from the bedload ratings. Data indicate that, as the exponent of the bedload rating increases from typical to more steep values, effective discharge increases from near-bankfull discharge to, in the present study, about 1{\textperiodcentered}3 bankfull discharge. This represents about a doubling of the recurrence interval. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2001 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

During sunny periods, trees transpire deoxygenated water from roots to the canopy but not in the dark, resulting in diurnal cycles of dissolved oxygen. Whole- stream shading experiments showed that photosynthesis in the stream is not responsible for the pattern. Sealed chamber measurements showed living roots of riparian vegetation had substantial respiratory activity and ammonium and nitrate uptake, and rates per unit area were greater than sand and less than silt (the other two dominant substrata), indicating roots can substantially alter in-stream biogeochemistry.},

Two MODIS vegetation indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations.},

abstract = {The main channel (MC), surface transient storage (STS), and hyporheic transient storage (HTS) zones provide unique habitats in streams. Most nutrient spiraling studies use models that aggregate the influence of the various transient storage zones on uptake and retention. This may explain contradictory results on drivers of nutrient cycling in streams. Here, a new two-storage zone transport model with Michaelis–Menten uptake kinetics was developed to quantify the relative role of the three stream compartments on the physical and biological transport of solutes and compared with a dynamic nutrient spiraling method (tracer additions for spiraling curve characterization). Both approaches are applied to coinjected conservative and reactive tracer tests in a stream with mean annual discharge {\textgreater}1.0 m3 s−1. The relative influence of the three stream compartments on in-stream uptake of NO3-N varied between reaches; each stream compartment dominated overall nitrate uptake in at least one subreach. HTS zones generally had greater influence on nitrate concentrations than STS zones because of longer residence times and faster uptake rates. However, a combination of geomorphology, MC-transient storage connectivity, residence time, compartment size, and uptake rate controls overall nutrient uptake capacity of a stream. Overall reach and compartment-specific uptake and uptake efficiency benefit from the upstream action of the transient storage zones during nutrient addition experiments, but STS and HTS contribute in different ways. Physical retention and biological uptake in STS zones contributed equally to overall reach uptake, but biological uptake in HTS zones overshadowed physical retention.},

abstract = {Headwater streams are key sites of nutrient and organic matter processing and retention, but little is known about temporal variability in gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) rates as a result of the short duration of most metabolism measurements in lotic ecosystems. We examined temporal variability and controls on ecosystem metabolism by measuring daily rates continuously for 2 years in Walker Branch, a first-order deciduous forest stream. Four important scales of temporal variability in ecosystem metabolism rates were identified: (1) seasonal, (2) day-to-day, (3) episodic (storm-related), and (4) inter-annual. Seasonal patterns were largely controlled by the leaf phenology and productivity of the deciduous riparian forest. Walker Branch was strongly net heterotrophic throughout the year with the exception of the open-canopy spring when GPP and ER rates were co-equal. Day-to-day variability in weather conditions influenced light reaching the streambed, resulting in high day-to-day variability in GPP particularly during spring (daily light levels explained 84{\%} of the variance in daily GPP in April). Episodic storms depressed GPP for several days in spring, but increased GPP in autumn by removing leaves shading the streambed. Storms depressed ER initially, but then stimulated ER to 2-3 times pre-storm levels for several days. Walker Branch was strongly net heterotrophic in both years of the study, with annual GPP being similar (488 and 519 g O-2 m(-2) y(-1) or 183 and 195 g C m(-2) y(-1)) but annual ER being higher in 2004 than 2005 (-1,645 vs. -1,292 g O-2 m(-2) y(-1) or -617 and -485 g C m(-2) y(-1) supercript stop). Inter-annual variability in ecosystem metabolism (assessed by comparing 2004 and 2005 rates with previous measurements) was the result of the storm frequency and timing and the size of the spring macroalgal bloom. Changes in local climate can have substantial impacts on stream ecosystem metabolism rates and ultimately influence the carbon source and sink properties of these important ecosystems.},

The prediction is: At an ecological steady state, the ratio of phytoplankton N : P to inorganic N : P in the euphotic zone equals the ratio of phytoplankton maximum uptake rates of N and P. We estimate this predicted ratio using nutrient uptake parameters measured in laboratory growth experiments and compare the predicted ratio to empirical observations from long-term sampling in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The model predictions for the ratio of phytoplankton N : P to inorganic N : P are at odds with the majority of data from extensive long-term sampling in the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. This discrepancy calls into question the scope of applicability of ecosystem models that explicitly describe phytoplankton growth as a function of N and P availability. We discuss efforts to resolve this discrepancy, including the need for performing more comprehensive N and P uptake experiments and by reexamining models of nutrient uptake. {\textcopyright} 2010, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

We use the expression nutrient dynamics for Studies that Included some measures of biological processes occurring within streams Prior to the 1970s, instream biological processes were little studied, but through 1985 conceptual advances were made, and 4 types of studies made important contributions to Our understanding of instream processes 1) evidence of increased plant production and decomposition in response to nutrient addition, 2) studies showing a downstream decrease in nutrient concentrations, 3) studies using radioisotopes, and 4) budget studies Beginning with the first paper printed in its first Issue, J-NABS has been the outlet for key papers advancing our understanding of rates and controls of nutrient dynamics in streams. In the first few years, an important review and a conceptual model for conducting experiments to study nutrient dynamics in streams were published in J-NABS In the 1990s, J-NABS published a number of papers on nutrient recycling within algal communities, the role of the hyporheic zone, the role of spawning fish, and the coupling of data from field N-15 additions and a N-cycling model to provide a synoptic view of N dynamics in streams Since 2000, J-NABS has published influential studies on nutrient criteria for streams, rates of and controls on nitrification and denitrification, uptake of stream nutrients by riparian vegetation, and nutrient dynamics in urban streams Nutrient dynamics will certainly continue to be an important topic in J-NABS Topics needing further study include. techniques for study in nutrient dynamics, nutrient dynamics in larger streams and rivers, the ultimate fate of nutrients taken up by plants and microbes in streams, ecological stoichiometry, the effects of climate change, and the role of streams and rivers in nutrient transformation and retention at the landscape scale.},

abstract = {Overland flow generation was monitored in large plots (8 × 25 m) on four hillslopes in a 4.9-ha catchment in Mie Prefecture, Japan. Three Japanese cypress (hinoki, Chamaecyparis obtusa) treatments (including three different understory conditions) and one deciduous forest treatment were studied. For all plots, including deciduous hillslopes, we observed overland flow even for small storm events ({\textless}10 mm in total precipitation). The mean runoff coefficients in dense Japanese cypress plots with sparse understory were highest (13.0{\%}) followed by dense Japanese cypress with fern ground cover (6.7{\%}), and coefficients in managed cypress and deciduous forest were 3.6{\%} and 1.2{\%}, respectively. The runoff coefficients tended to be higher during storms that were preceded by dry conditions. High soil water repellency initially occurred in Japanese cypress forests between the litter and mineral soil horizon and might have been partly responsible for overland flow generation. During storms with total precipitation {\textgreater}180 mm, runoff from Japanese cypress plots with dense fern understory exhibited a delayed and higher peak associated with return flow. The dominance of hillslope-scale flow contribution to catchment runoff was also affected by changes in the dominance of overland flow and return flow. Understory vegetation cover and the availability of a litter layer altered the amount of overland flow, which was mediated by soil water repellency and soil moisture. Observations at the hillslope scale are essential for conceptualization of runoff mechanisms and pathways in forested headwaters. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The scale dependence of nutrient loads exported from a catchment is a function of complex interactions between hydrologic and biogeochemical processes that modulate the input signals from the hillslope by aggregation and attenuation in a converging river network. Observational data support an empirical inverse relation between the biogeochemical cycling rate constant for nitrate k (T -1) and the stream stage h (L), k = v f/h, with v f, the uptake velocity (LT -1), being constant in space under steady flow conditions. Here we offer a physical explanation for the persistence of this pattern across scales and then extend the analysis to spatiotemporal scaling of k under transient-flow conditions. Inverse k-h dependence arose as an emergent pattern by coupling the mechanistic Transient Storage Model with a network model. Analytical modeling indicated that (1) nitrate processing efficiency increases with increasing variability in the discharge Q and (2) temporal averaging had no effect on the exponent a of the k-h relationship (k = v f/h a) in catchments with low Q variability, but strong dependence arose in catchments with high variability in Q. Network modeling in domains with low Q variability confirmed that the exponent a was independent of temporal averaging, but v f was a function of the averaging timescale. The probability distribution functions for k could be adequately predicted using analytical approaches. Understanding the k-h scaling relationships enables the direct estimation of the variability in nutrient losses due to in-stream reactions without requiring explicit information for spatially distributed network modeling.

abstract = {In-stream nutrient retention results from the interaction between hydrological and biogeochemical processes involved in downstream transport. While hydrological processes set the opportunity for nutrient retention to occur, metabolic activity and abiotic processes determine the potential biogeochemical reactivity of streams. Yet, a comprehensive assessment of the relevance of hydrological opportunity versus biogeochemical reactivity on the variability of nutrient retention across streams is still missing. We compiled an extensive data set of existing studies on nutrient retention for ammonium, nitrate, and soluble reactive phosphorus to explore how variability in hydrological opportunity and biogeochemical reactivity explain nutrient retention. We quantified the relative contribution of hydrological opportunity and biogeochemical reactivity to the observed variability in stream nutrient retention using a linearization of the retention equation, which allows for an exact partitioning of the variance associated with residence time and nutrient uptake rate. Finally, we explored potential patterns of nutrient retention along the river network resulting from the interaction between hydrological opportunity and biogeochemical reactivity. Our results show that biogeochemical reactivity has a more relevant role on nutrient retention variability than previously thought, explaining over 66{\%} of the variability in nutrient retention. Among the studied nutrients, retention variability of ammonium was the most subjected to biogeochemical reactivity controls. Furthermore, our results provide insights on controls of longitudinal patterns of nutrient retention along river networks, indicating that retention per unit length for the three nutrients will most likely decrease from headwaters to river mouth because of a decrease in water residence time.},

abstract = {Mesocosms from two subarctic heaths from high and low altitudes, respectively, and differing in the composition of vegetation were experimentally subjected to 18 diurnal freeze-thaw cycles fluctuating between day temperatures of +2°C and night temperatures of -4°C. Mesocosm respiration was consistently lower and higher in cycled mesocosms compared to mesocosms kept unfrozen (+2°C) and frozen (-4°C), respectively. When extrapolated to the entire non-growing season, our data suggest a non-growing season carbon (C) loss in the order of 20-30 g C m-2, which is substantial compared with a likely annual incorporation of plant biomass C of 150-200 g C m-2 per year. The results support the hypothesis that winter carbon fluxes must be included in annual carbon budgets for arctic ecosystems. Microbial biomass C decreased only in cycled mesocosms, indicating that while microbial activity is mainly controlled by temperature, microbial biomass is strongly affected by temperature fluctuations around the freezing point. In contrast to microbial C, microbial biomass nitrogen (N) mass did not change in cycled mesocosms, leading to decreased microbial C to N ratio. Second, soil inorganic N concentration declined in the soils subjected to the cycles, showing that microbes surviving the freeze-thaw cycles had a high potential for sequestering soil N and N that presumably was released from dead microbes. The two sets of mesocosms responded very similarly to the freeze-thaw cycles, indicating that the observed responses to multiple diurnal freeze-thaw cycles are common for both ecosystem types despite the differences in plant species composition and climate. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Of the added DOC, 85{\%} was retained within the treatment reach, which increased ecosystem respiration with respect to the reference reach. Alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) increased from day 1 to day 6; however, water column P uptake only increased on day 6 concurrent with the NH+4 addition. Gross primary production decreased during the DOC addition relative to the reference reach, yet seemed to recover on day 6 (NH+4 addition). These results suggest that during the DOC addition, heterotrophs out-competed autotrophs for N and that sediment-sorbed P sustained the heterotrophic community while P uptake from the water column was dominated by autotrophs. Because APA and P uptake were stimulated by the simultaneous DOC and NH+4 addition, P cycling appeared to be N limited, despite the high ambient NO-3 concentration; this indicates a strong preferential uptake of NH4 over NO+4: In streams, C and P cycling can be intrinsically coupled through biological mechanisms, and this coupling can be mediated by the availability of different forms of inorganic N. {\textcopyright} 2013, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {The absolute concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) and their relative availabilities (N:P stoichiometry) can influence numerous ecological processes. In streams, N:P stoichiometry is influenced by different hydrologic and biogeochemical processes that also affect the downstream transport of these nutrients to receiving waters. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) deposition, a widespread geochemical process in alkaline streams and other aquatic ecosystems, can lower phosphate concentrations and, potentially, decrease P availability relative to N availability. We evaluated the effects of CaCO3 deposition on stream water stoichiometry using a 3-year dataset of stream physicochemistry and several metrics of CaCO3 deposition across three streams in the Huachuca Mountains of southern Arizona, USA. CaCO3 deposition rates varied across and within streams, with benthic coverage of travertine as high as 70 {\%} and deposition rates up to 8.3 $\mu$g Ca2+ L−1 m−1. Redundancy analysis revealed a strong, negative correlation between stream water phosphate concentrations and CaCO3 deposition rates, a relationship that also extended to total P concentrations, and a strong, positive correlation between inorganic N concentrations and CaCO3 deposition rates. Furthermore, we found a significant positive relationship between CaCO3 deposition rates and N:P ratios. These results support the role of coprecipitation of phosphate with CaCO3 deposition in reducing P supply. They also suggest that reduced concentrations of P in the water column may reduce biological N uptake, amplifying the stoichiometric signal of CaCO3 deposition.},

abstract = {The interstitial spaces within streambeds are recognized as an important location of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) transformations in streams. However, it remains uncertain how physical characteristics of streambeds affect the magnitude and net outcome of subsurface nitrogen transformations. We tested whether the size distribution of streambed sediments, in isolation from the influence of streambed topography and groundwater upwelling, could affect net DIN uptake or production along interstitial flow paths. Mesocosms constructed from PVC pipe (15 cm diameter 9 1 m long) were filled with either coarse gravel/cobble or gravel/cobble mixed with finer sediments (5 mesocosms per sediment treatment). Mesocosms were submerged in a stream and oriented, so that surface water flowed through the sediments. After 2 months incubation, we measured DIN in interstitial water at 20 cm intervals and dissolved oxygen at 10 cm intervals along mesocosm flow paths. In both sediment types, DIN concentrations increased longitudinally along mesocosm flow paths in the direction of interstitial flow, indicating net DIN production. Although DIN increased to higher concentrations in mesocosms with fine sediments, greater exchange flow through coarse sediments resulted in similar rates of net DIN production and delivery to surface water. Production of DIN in both sediment types was concentrated within the first 10 cm of interstitial flow paths, with no significant production further along the flow paths. Coarse sediments had higher rates of oxygen consumption per unit sediment volume than the coarse-fine sediment mix, suggesting interstitial water velocity may be an important factor affecting hyporheic microbial metabolism. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2010.},

abstract = {To test how benthic biogeochemistry responds to changing nutrient availability and estuary trophic state, I conducted mesocosm and field experiments. In the mesocosm experiment, sediment cores from eutrophic and oligotrophic estuaries were incubated under high or low nutrient levels. Net production rates were greater in eutrophic vs. oligotrophic cores while respiration rates were greater in high nutrient treatments, indicating that sediment metabolism was affected by trophic history and nutrient availability. Sediment organic matter (SOM) composition was insensitive to the nutrient treatments but varied with trophic history as carbon: nitrogen ratios were lower, $\delta$15N was higher, and algal and bacterial fatty acids (FAs) were more abundant in eutrophic sediments. In the field experiment, intact cores were reciprocally transplanted between eutrophic and oligotrophic estuaries and changes in SOM composition were followed over four months. SOM responses were more dramatic in cores transplanted to the oligotrophic vs. eutrophic estuary. In sediments moved from the eutrophic to oligotrophic estuary, carbon and nitrogen content as well as abundances of algal and bacterial FAs fell within one month. Conversely, sediment $\delta$15N increased sharply while algal and bacterial FAs rose slightly in cores transplanted from the oligotrophic to eutrophic estuary. Different SOM responses between the experiments were likely due to direct vs. indirect effects of nutrient enrichment. Nutrient levels were manipulated in the mesocosm experiment while the estuaries differed in nutrients, macroalgal biomass, benthic animal communities, and oxygen levels. Consequently, sediment biogeochemical responses to watershed nutrient mitigation will likely follow broader changes in estuary habitat quality.},

We use the expression nutrient dynamics for Studies that Included some measures of biological processes occurring within streams Prior to the 1970s, instream biological processes were little studied, but through 1985 conceptual advances were made, and 4 types of studies made important contributions to Our understanding of instream processes 1) evidence of increased plant production and decomposition in response to nutrient addition, 2) studies showing a downstream decrease in nutrient concentrations, 3) studies using radioisotopes, and 4) budget studies Beginning with the first paper printed in its first Issue, J-NABS has been the outlet for key papers advancing our understanding of rates and controls of nutrient dynamics in streams. In the first few years, an important review and a conceptual model for conducting experiments to study nutrient dynamics in streams were published in J-NABS In the 1990s, J-NABS published a number of papers on nutrient recycling within algal communities, the role of the hyporheic zone, the role of spawning fish, and the coupling of data from field N-15 additions and a N-cycling model to provide a synoptic view of N dynamics in streams Since 2000, J-NABS has published influential studies on nutrient criteria for streams, rates of and controls on nitrification and denitrification, uptake of stream nutrients by riparian vegetation, and nutrient dynamics in urban streams Nutrient dynamics will certainly continue to be an important topic in J-NABS Topics needing further study include. techniques for study in nutrient dynamics, nutrient dynamics in larger streams and rivers, the ultimate fate of nutrients taken up by plants and microbes in streams, ecological stoichiometry, the effects of climate change, and the role of streams and rivers in nutrient transformation and retention at the landscape scale.},

abstract = {River systems are dynamic, highly connected water transfer networks that integrate a wide range of physical and biological processes. We used a river network nitrogen (N) removal model with daily temporal resolution to evaluate how elevated N inputs, saturation of the denitrification and total nitrate removal processes, and hydrologie conditions interact to determine the amount, timing and distribution of N removal in the fifth-order river network of a suburban 400 km2 basin. Denitrification parameters were based on results from whole reach 15NO3 tracer additions. The model predicted that between 15 and 33{\%} of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) inputs were denitrified annually by the river system. Removal approached 100{\%} during low flow periods, even with the relatively low and saturating uptake velocities typical of surface water denitrification. Annual removal percentages were moderate because most N inputs occurred during high flow periods when hydraulic conditions and temperatures are less favorable for removal by channel processes. Nevertheless, the percentage of annual removal occurring during above average flow periods was similar to that during low flow periods. Predicted river network removal proportions are most sensitive to loading rates, spatial heterogeneity of inputs, and the form of the removal process equation during typical base flow conditions. However, comparison with observations indicates that removal by the river network is higher than predicted by the model at moderately high flows, suggesting additional removal processes are important at these times. Further increases in N input to the network will lead to disproportionate increases in N exports due to the limits imposed by process saturation. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

Evidence for multi-element limitation (i.e., colimitation) of a variety of ecosystem processes is growing rapidly, yet our ability to quantify patterns of coupled nutrient dynamics at the ecosystem level has been hindered by logistical and methodological constraints. Here we quantify coupled nitrogen and phosphorus uptake kinetics in three oligotrophic mountain streams by using novel experimental techniques that quantify colimitation dynamics across a range of nutrient concentrations and stoichiometries. We show that relative demand for NO3-N and PO4-P varied across streams, but that short term availability of one nutrient consistently resulted in elevated, but variable, uptake of the other nutrient at all sites. We used temporally offset, pulsed nutrient additions to parameterize dual-nutrient Michaelis–Menten uptake surface models that represent NO3-N and PO4-P uptake at any given concentration or dissolved NO3-N:PO4-P stoichiometry. Our results indicated that the uptake of N and P were strongly enhanced in the presence of the other nutrient. Surface models quantitatively reflect patterns of colimitation and multi-element demand in streams, and should allow for parameterization of more realistic stream network models that explicitly account for interactions among element cycles.},

Theoretical models of photoautotrophic systems attribute the absence of diel uptake variation to nutrient scarcity, such that diel variability in nutrient uptake disappears as nutrients become limiting. We tested this prediction in a mesocosm experiment, by exposing benthic algal communities to a range of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus concentrations and recording the rates of uptake during both day and night. We found that higher concentrations of N produced diel variability in uptake and that the difference between the day and night total mass uptakes approximately equaled N demand for observed primary production as seen in other studies. At lower concentrations of N, uptake rates during the day and night were indistinguishable. These results are the first empirical evidence to imply that diel nitrate patterns in streams and rivers indicate a release from N limitation and offer a new way to assess nutrient limitation.},

abstract = {Transient storage zones for water represent potential hot spots for metabolic activity in streams. In lowland rivers, the high abundance of submerged vegetation can increase water transient storage, bioreactive surface areas, and, ultimately, in-stream metabolic activity. Changes in flow resulting from climatic and anthropogenic factors that influence the presence of aquatic vegetation can also, thereby, impact in-stream metabolism and nutrient cycling. We investigated the effects of water column depth on aquatic vegetation cover and its implications on water transient storage and associated metabolic activity in stream mesocosms (n = 8) that represent typical conditions of lowland streams. Continuous injections of metabolically reactive (resazurin-resorufin) tracers were conducted and used to quantify hydraulic transport and whole-mesocosm aerobic respiration. Acetate, a labile carbon source, was added during a second stage of the tracer injection to investigate metabolic responses. We observed both higher vegetation coverage and resazurin uptake velocity, used as a proxy of mesocosm respiration, with increasing water column depth. The acetate injection had a slight, positive effect on metabolic activity. A hydrodynamic model estimated the water transport and retention characteristics and first-order reactivity for three mesocosms. These results suggest that both the vegetated surface water and sediments contribute to metabolically active transient storage within the mesocosms, with vegetation having a greater influence on ecosystem respiration. Our findings suggest that climate and external factors that affect flow and submerged vegetation of lowland rivers will result in changes in stream respiration dynamics and that submerged vegetation is a particularly important and sensitive location for stream respiration.},

New production, approximated and diagnosed as an exponential uptake of nutrients within the euphotic zone, increases with model resolution. Nutrient is supplied for new production where isopycnals from the subsurface outcrop at the base of the euphotic zone, primarily at fronts.

abstract = {River networks modify material transfer from land to ocean. Understanding the factors regulating this function for different gaseous, dissolved, and particulate constituents is critical to quantify the local and global effects of climate and land use change. We propose the River Network Saturation (RNS) concept as a generalization of how river network regulation of material fluxes declines with increasing flows due to imbalances between supply and demand at network scales. River networks have a tendency to become saturated (supply ≫ demand) under higher flow conditions because supplies increase faster than sink processes. However, the flow thresholds under which saturation occurs depends on a variety of factors, including the inherent process rate for a given constituent and the abundance of lentic waters such as lakes, ponds, reservoirs, and fluvial wetlands within the river network. As supply increases, saturation at network scales is initially limited by previously unmet demand in downstream aquatic ecosystems. The RNS concept describes a general tendency of river network function that can be used to compare the fate of different constituents among river networks. New approaches using nested in situ high-frequency sensors and spatially extensive synoptic techniques offer the potential to test the RNS concept in different settings. Better understanding of when and where river networks saturate for different constituents will allow for the extrapolation of aquatic function to broader spatial scales and therefore provide information on the influence of river function on continental element cycles and help identify policy priorities.},

We assessed DON cycling in a N-limited headwater forest stream via whole-ecosystem additions of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and labile dissolved organic matter (DOM), hydrologic transport and biogeochemical modeling, and laboratory experiments with native sediments. We sampled surface and subsurface waters to understand how interaction among hydrologic exchange, DIN, DON, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) influence stream N losses at summer baseflow. Added DON was taken up rapidly from the water column at rates exceeding DOC and DIN. A significant fraction of this DON was mineralized and nitrified. Combined DON and NO3-N uptake lengths resulted in spiraling lengths of ∼210 m, suggesting the potential for multiple transformations of labile N loads within catchment boundaries. Simultaneous addition of DIN increased DOM uptake, but more so for C, resulting in an upward shift in the C:N ratio of uptake. Sediment incubations also showed a strong biotic influence on DOC and DON dynamics. Despite efficient uptake of added DOM, background DON and high molecular mass DOC concentrations increased downstream, resulting in higher DOM loads than could be accounted for by groundwater discharge and suggesting net release of less bioavailable forms from the channel/hyporheic zone. At the same time, subsurface DOM was characterized by very low C:N ratios and a disproportionately large DON pool despite rapid hydrologic mixing with dilute and high C:N ratio surface waters. Analysis of expected DON loads from conservative hyporheic fluxes indicated that watershed losses of DON would have been seven times greater in the absence of apparent benthic demand, suggesting tight internal cycling of subsurface DON. Our study further demonstrates the potential for significant transformation of N in headwater streams before export to downstream ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

We estimate this predicted ratio using nutrient uptake parameters measured in laboratory growth experiments and compare the predicted ratio to empirical observations from long-term sampling in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The model predictions for the ratio of phytoplankton N : P to inorganic N : P are at odds with the majority of data from extensive long-term sampling in the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. This discrepancy calls into question the scope of applicability of ecosystem models that explicitly describe phytoplankton growth as a function of N and P availability.

We use a dynamic stream transport model to assess biogeochemical (nitrate loadings, concentration, temperature) and hydrological (discharge, depth, velocity) effects on reach-scale denitrification and nitrate removal in the river networks of two watersheds having widely differing levels of nitrate enrichment but nearly identical discharges. Stream denitrification is estimated by regression as a nonlinear function of nitrate concentration, streamflow, and temperature, using more than 300 published measurements from a variety of US streams. These relations are used in the stream transport model to characterize nitrate dynamics related to denitrification at a monthly time scale in the stream reaches of the two watersheds. Results indicate that the nitrate removal efficiency of streams, as measured by the percentage of the stream nitrate flux removed via denitrification per unit length of channel, is appreciably reduced during months with high discharge and nitrate flux and increases during months of low-discharge and flux. Biogeochemical factors, including land use, nitrate inputs, and stream concentrations, are a major control on reach-scale denitrification, evidenced by the disproportionately lower nitrate removal efficiency in streams of the highly nitrate-enriched watershed as compared with that in similarly sized streams in the less nitrate-enriched watershed. Sensitivity analyses reveal that these important biogeochemical factors and physical hydrological factors contribute nearly equally to seasonal and stream-size related variations in the percentage of the stream nitrate flux removed in each watershed.},

abstract = {Headwater streams are foci for nutrient and energy loading from terrestrial landscapes, in situ nutrient transformations, and downstream transport. Despite the prominent role that headwater streams can have in regulating downstream water quality, the relative importance of processes that can influence nutrient uptake have not been fully compared in heterotrophic aquatic systems. To address this research need, we assessed the seasonality of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrate (NO3−) uptake, compared the relative influence of hydrologic and biogeochemical drivers on observed seasonal trends in nutrient uptake, and estimated the influence of these biological transformations on watershed scale nutrient retention and export. We determined that seasonal reductions in DOC and NO3− concentrations led to decreases in the potential for the biotic community to take up nutrients, and that seasonality of DOC and NO3− uptake was consistent with the seasonal dynamics of ecosystem metabolism. We calculated that that during the post-snowmelt period (June to August), biotic retention of both dissolved organic carbon and nitrate exceeded export fluxes from this headwater catchment, highlighting the potential for biological processes to regulate downstream water quality.},

abstract = {We studied nutrient uptake in relation to water chemistry, stream hydrodynamics, and ecosystem metabolism in two eutrophic lowland streams located near Berlin, Germany. Ambient nutrient uptake rates ranged from 0.180 to 12.880 g NO3-N m-2 d-1, from 0.035 to 0.517 g NH 4-N m-2 d-1, and from 0.017 to 0.750 g PO 4-P m-2 d-1. Temporal and spatial variability in nutrient uptake rates within single streams were mainly controlled by concentrations of metabolic substrates (i.e., nutrients, dissolved organic carbon, and dissolved oxygen) and rates of ecosystem metabolism, highlighting the importance of assimilative nutrient uptake. According to stoichiometric accounts, dissimilative uptake of dissolved inorganic nitrogen was an important uptake mechanism. Thus, nutrient uptake was subject to controls similar to those reported from pristine study sites, indicating that basic patterns of nutrient retention are comparable in pristine and eutrophic streams. In contrast to pristine streams, eutrophic streams exhibited long nutrient uptake lengths (in the range of several kilometers), as elevated uptake rates could only partially compensate for high nutrient loads. Our results indicate that ecosystem nutrient uptake is unable to efficiently reduce nutrient exports from the investigated eutrophic lowland streams. {\textcopyright} 2006, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {We examine the impact of mesoscale dynamics on the seasonal cycle of primary production in the Arabian Sea with an eddy-resolving (1/12) bio-physical model. Comparison with observations indicates that the numerical model provides a realistic description of climatological physical and biogeochemical fields as well as their mesoscale variability during the Southwest and Northeast Monsoons. We show that mesoscale dynamics favors biological production by modulating the nutrient supplies throughout the year. Different processes are involved depending on the blooming season. During the summer bloom period, we found that the main process is the export of nutrients from coastal upwelling regions into the central Arabian Sea by mesoscale filaments. Our model suggests that lateral advection accounts for 50-70{\%} of the total supply of nutrients to the central AS. A less expected result is the major input of nutrients (up to 60-90{\%}) supplied to upwelling regions during the early stage of the summer bloom period by eddy-induced vertical advection. During the winter bloom period, our model evidences for the first time how vertical velocities associated with mesoscale structures increase the supply of nutrients to the upper layer by 40-50{\%} in the central Arabian Sea. Finally, the restratification effect of mesoscale structures modulates spatially and temporally the restratification that occurs at large-scale at the end of the Northeast Monsoon. Although this effect has no significant impact on the large-scale budget, it could be a source of uncertainty in satellite and in-situ observations.

abstract = {We have used a dynamic hydrologic network model, coupled with a transient storage zone solute transport model, to simulate dissolved nutrient retention processes during transient flow events at the channel network scale. We explored several scenarios with a combination of rainfall variability, and biological and geomorphic characteristics of the catchment, to understand the dominant factors that control the transport of dissolved nutrients (e.g., nitrate) along channel networks. While much experimental work has focused on studying nutrient retention during base flow periods in headwater streams, our model-based theoretical analyses, for the given parameter combinations used, suggest that high-flow periods can contribute substantially to overall nutrient retention, and that bulk nutrient retention is greater in larger rivers compared to headwaters. The relative efficiencies of nutrient retention during high- and low-flow periods vary due to changes in the relative sizes of the main channel and transient storage zones, as well as due to differences in the relative strengths of the various nutrient retention mechanisms operating in both zones. Our results also indicate that nutrient retention efficiency at all spatial scales of observation has strong dependence on within-year variability of streamflow (e.g., frequency and duration of high and low flows), as well as on the relative magnitudes of the coefficients that govern biogeochemical uptake processes: the more variable the streamflow, the greater the export of nutrients. Despite limitations of the model parameterizations, our results suggest that increased attention must be paid to field observations of the interactions between process hydrology and nutrient transport and reaction processes at a range of scales to assist with extrapolation of understandings and estimates gained from site-specific studies to ungauged basins across gradients in climate, human impacts, and landscape characteristics. {\textcopyright} 2012.

Human activities have been changing in-stream nutrient concentrations, thereby altering lotic ecosystem functioning, especially in developing countries. We estimated nutrient uptake metrics (ambient uptake length, areal uptake rate, and uptake velocity) for nitrate (NO3-N), ammonium (NH4-N), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) in four tropical Cerrado headwater streams during 2017, through whole-stream nutrient addition experiments. According to multiple regression models, ambient SRP concentration was an important explanatory variable of nutrient uptake. Further, best models included ambient NO3-N and water velocity (for NO3-N uptake metrics), dissolved oxygen (DO) and canopy cover (for NH4-N); and DO, discharge, water velocity, and temperature (for SRP). The best kinetic models describing nutrient uptake were efficiency-loss (R2 from 0.47-0.88) and first-order models (R2 from 0.60-0.85). NO3-N, NH4-N, and SRP uptake in these streams seemed coupled as a result of complex interactions of biotic P limitation, abiotic P cycling processes, and the preferential uptake of NH4-N among N-forms. Global change effects on these tropical streams, such as temperature increase and nutrient enrichment due to urban and agricultural expansion, may have adverse and partially unpredictable impacts on whole-stream nutrient processing.},

Here representations ranging from simple parameterizations to vertically resolved diagenetic models are compared against a comprehensive, multi-year data set from a mesocosm eutrophication study. Observations of sediment-water fluxes of nutrients and oxygen and measurements of the state of the overlying water column were made over 2.5 years in nine mesocosms, six of which received geometrically increasing loads of inorganic nutrients. These observations are used here to force and optimize two simple parameterizations of sediment oxygen uptake, one representative two-layer diagenetic model and one representative multi-layer diagenetic model. In cross-validation experiments the predictive ability of these different representations is compared. The main results are that the optimized multi-layer model fits the observations best and also proved to be the most parsimonious, while the two-layer model failed the cross-validation indicating that it is prone to over-fitting and was less parsimonious even than one of the simpler functional oxygen flux models. We recommend that sediment models that are candidates for inclusion in a biogeochemical model be assessed through a process of optimization and cross-validation as we have done here. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

To ask whether environmental microbial communities have capacity to recover after a large disturbance event, we conducted a whole-ecosystem manipulation, during which we imposed an intense disturbance on freshwater microbial communities by artificially mixing a temperate lake during peak summer thermal stratification. We employed environmental sensors and water chemistry analyses to evaluate the physical and chemical responses of the lake, and bar-coded 16S ribosomal RNA gene pyrosequencing and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) to assess the bacterial community responses. The artificial mixing increased mean lake temperature from 14 to 20°C for seven weeks after mixing ended, and exposed the microorganisms to very different environmental conditions, including increased hypolimnion oxygen and increased epilimnion carbon dioxide concentrations. Though overall ecosystem conditions remained altered (with hypolimnion temperatures elevated from 6 to 20°C), bacterial communities returned to their pre-manipulation state as some environmental conditions, such as oxygen concentration, recovered. Recovery to pre-disturbance community composition and diversity was observed within 7 (epilimnion) and 11 (hypolimnion) days after mixing. Our results suggest that some microbial communities have capacity to recover after a major disturbance. {\textcopyright} 2012 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This study compares the performance of three bioretention media blends for N and P removal from simulated urban runoff in experimental mesocosms. TerraSolve, Biofilter, and "VT Mix" (Virginia Tech) were compared with and without vegetation at varying hydraulic residence times (HRTs). Adsorption isotherm experiments were also conducted. TerraSolve and VT Mix included water treatment residuals (WTRs), Biofilter and VT Mix included yard-waste compost (YWC), and TerraSolve included a mix of coir and peat. TerraSolve removed the highest amount of total P ({\textgreater}95{\%}), which is attributed to the high quantity of WTRs. Results were similar for VT Mix, likely due to WTR content. Adsorption isotherms indicate a substantial difference due to this factor. Vegetative mesocosms were found to be less effective at P removal at an HRT of 6 to 12 h but not at an HRT of 24 h. VT Mix had the highest removal of total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), significantly different than the other blends. Interactive effects with vegetation were observed, generally improving TKN removal at all HRTs, with the highest at 24 h. Substantial export of nutrients when using compost was not observed. The addition of YWC appeared to increase N removal, possibly by denitrification. It is recommended that bioretention media contain {\&}{\#}60;10{\%} fines, a source of amorphous Al for P adsorption, at least 3 to 5{\%} total organic C in the form of a low P, relatively stable compost, and a minimum concentration of plant-available nutrients for establishment of vegetation.

abstract = {1. Ecological stoichiometry deals with the mass balance of multiple key elements [e.g. carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P)] in ecological systems. This conceptual framework, largely developed in the pelagic zone of lakes, has been successfully applied to topics ranging from population dynamics to biogeochemical cycling. More recently, an explicit stoichiometric approach has also been used in many other environments, including freshwater benthic ecosystems. 2. Description of elemental patterns among benthic resources and consumers provides a useful starting point for understanding causes of variation and stoichiometric imbalance in feeding interactions. Although there is considerable overlap among categories, terrestrially-derived resources, such as wood, leaf litter and green leaves have substantially higher C : nutrient ratios than other resources of both terrestrial and aquatic origin, such as periphyton and fine particulate organic matter. The elemental composition of these resources for benthic consumers is modulated by a range of factors and processes, including nutrient availability and ratios, particle size and microbial colonisation. 3. Among consumers in benthic systems, bacteria are the most nutrient-rich, followed (in descending order) by fishes, invertebrate predators, invertebrate primary consumers, and fungi. Differences in consumer C : nutrient ratios appear to be related to broad-scale phylogenetic differences which determine body size, growth rate and resource allocation to structural body constituents (e.g. P-rich bone). 4. Benthic consumers can influence the stoichiometry of dissolved nutrients and basal resources in multiple ways. Direct consumption alters the stoichiometry of food resources by increasing nutrient availability (e.g. reduced boundary layer thickness on substrata) or through removal of nutrient-rich patches (e.g. selective feeding on fungal patches within leaf litter). In addition, consumers alter the stoichiometry of resources and dissolved nutrient pools through the return of egested or excreted nutrients. In some cases, consumer excretion supplies a large proportion of the nutrients required by algae and heterotrophic microbes and alters elemental ratios of dissolved nutrient pools. 5. Organic matter decomposition in benthic systems is accompanied by significant changes in the elemental composition of organic matter. Microbial colonisation of leaf litter influences C : nutrient ratios, and patterns of microbial succession (e.g. fungi followed by bacteria) may be under some degree of stoichiometric control. Large elemental imbalances exist between particulate organic matter and detritivores, which is likely to constrain growth rates and invertebrate secondary production. Such imbalances may therefore select for behavioural and other strategies for dealing with them. Comminution of large particles by benthic consumers alters detrital C : nutrient ratios and can influence the stoichiometry of elemental export from whole catchments. 6. A stoichiometric framework is likely to advance understanding of biogeochemical cycling in benthic ecosystems. A set of scenarios is developed that explores the influence of microbial elemental composition on nutrient spiralling parameters in streams, such as uptake length and uptake rate ratios. The presented hypothetical examples identify when the elemental composition of benthic stream organisms is likely to predict nutrient uptake ratios and conditions that would cause benthic stoichiometry and nutrient uptake from the water column to become uncoupled. {\textcopyright} 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Homeostatic organisms regulate their elemental composition by retaining nutrients that are limiting and eliminating those in excess. We argue that this type of homeostatic regulation by consumers might decouple the downstream movement of limiting and nonlimiting nutrients in streams. To illustrate the influence of consumers on nutrient spiraling, we developed a longitudinal model of stream nutrient dynamics that explicitly incorporates stoichiometry and recycling. First, we simulated N- and P-tracer addition experiments in a P-limited stream with a particle-tracking algorithm that allowed us to follow the pathways of N and P atoms in the model ecosystem. Then, we varied the biomass, N:P ratio, and strength of stoichiometric regulation of consumers to quantify how these parameters affected modeled spiraling metrics. The particle-tracking simulation showed that the average time for a nutrient atom to complete a spiral increased with the fraction of atoms that entered the consumer compartment in each spiral, which in turn, increased with increasing consumer biomass. Increasing the consumer N:P ratio to exacerbate consumer stoichiometric imbalance with food resources changed the residence times of nutrients in the food web by increasing the downstream velocity of the nonlimiting nutrient and delaying downstream transport of the limiting nutrient. Decreasing the strength of stoichiometric regulation of consumers dampened the observed effects of increased consumer biomass and N:P ratios on nutrient spiraling. Our model results illustrate that consumers have the potential to influence stream nutrient dynamics through differential excretion of limiting and nonlimiting nutrients, but only at relatively high biomass. Stream biogeochemistry has largely focused on factors controlling the uptake of dissolved nutrients, but understanding how these nutrients are retained and recycled once they enter the stream food web will lead to a more complete understanding of nutrient dynamics in streams.},

abstract = {Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) can limit autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolism in lotic ecosystems, yet most studies that evaluate biotic responses to colimitation focus on patch-scale (e.g., nutrient diffusing substrata) rather than stream-scale responses. In this study, we evaluated the effects of single and dual N and P additions on ambient nutrient uptake rates and saturation kinetics during two biologically contrasting seasons (spring, autumn) in Walker Branch, a temperate forested headwater stream in Tennessee, USA. In each season, we used separate instantaneous pulse additions to quantify nutrient uptake rates and saturation kinetics of N (nitrate) and P (phosphate). We then used steady-state injections to elevate background stream water concentrations (to low and then high background concentrations) of one nutrient (e.g., N) and released instantaneous pulses of the other nutrient (e.g., P). We predicted that elevating the background concentration of one nutrient would result in a lower ambient uptake length and a higher maximum areal uptake rate of the other nutrient in this colimited stream. Our prediction held true in spring, as maximum areal uptake rate of N increased with elevated P concentrations from 185 lg m22 min21 (no added P) to 354 lg m22 min21 (high P). This pattern was not observed in autumn, as uptake rates of N were not measurable when P was elevated. Further, elevating background N concentration in either season did not significantly increase P uptake rates, likely because adsorption rather than biotic uptake dominated P dynamics. Laboratory P sorption assays demonstrated that Walker Branch sediments had a high adsorption capacity and were likely a sink for P during most pulse nutrient additions. Therefore, it may be difficult to use coupled pulse nutrient additions to evaluate biotic uptake of N and P in streams with strong P adsorption potential. Future efforts should use dual nutrient addition techniques to investigate reach-scale coupled biogeochemical cycles (C–N–P, and other elemental cycles [e.g., Fe, Mo]) across seasons, biomes, and land-use types and over longer time periods.},

abstract = {Reducing phosphorus (P) concentration in surface water is a primary component of the ongoing effort to restore the Florida Everglades. Engineered wetlands are currently being used to retain P from stormwater inflows but are not consistently achieving outflow P concentration goals. A three-year mesocosm study was performed investigating the effects of different plant communities on P retention within engineered wetlands. A dynamic model was constructed in the high-level simulation software STELLA, using water, soil, weather, and plant data from this mesocosm study. The model consists of three interconnected submodels: plant growth, hydrology, and P dynamics. The model simulates processes in water and soil related to all four forms of P: dissolved organic, dissolved inorganic, particulate organic, and particulate inorganic. Model verification and subsequent calibration was performed using biweekly outflow water quality data from a mesocosm containing a submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) community consisting of Najas guadalupensis and the algae Chara sp. Model validation was then conducted using data from separate mesocosms with three different plant communities: monocultures of Typha domingensis or Cladium jamaicense, and a combination of Nymphaea odorata and SAV. The model was able to simulate outflow concentrations of total phosphorus from all four plant communities with average relative errors of less than 35{\%}. A sensitivity analysis revealed the relative importance of the various processes involved in the retention of all P forms and the effects of different vegetation communities on these processes. Further simulations were run to predict the outflow total P concentrations for an additional year beyond the end of the mesocosm study.},

abstract = {Along the river network, water, sediment, and nutrients are transported, cycled, and altered by coupled hydrological and biogeochemical processes. Our current understanding of the rates and processes controlling the cycling and removal of dissolved inorganic nutrients in river networks is limited due to a lack of empirical measurements in large, (nonwadeable), rivers. The goal of this paper was to develop a coupled hydrological and biogeochemical process model to simulate nutrient uptake at the network scale during summer base flow conditions. The model was parameterized with literature values from headwater streams, and empirical measurements made in 15 rivers with varying hydrological, biological, and topographic characteristics, to simulate nutrient uptake at the network scale. We applied the coupled model to 15 catchments describing patterns in uptake for three different solutes to determine the role of rivers in network-scale nutrient cycling. Model simulation results, constrained by empirical data, suggested that rivers contributed proportionally more to nutrient removal than headwater streams given the fraction of their length represented in a network. In addition, variability of nutrient removal patterns among catchments was varied among solutes, and as expected, was influenced by nutrient concentration and discharge. Net ammonium uptake was not significantly correlated with any environmental descriptor. In contrast, net daily nitrate removal was linked to suspended chlorophyll a (an indicator of primary producers) and land use characteristics. Finally, suspended sediment characteristics and agricultural land use were correlated with net daily removal of soluble reactive phosphorus, likely reflecting abiotic sorption dynamics. Rivers are understudied relative to streams, and our model suggests that rivers can contribute more to network-scale nutrient removal than would be expected based upon their representative fraction of network channel length.},

abstract = {1. Nutrient spiralling provides a conceptual framework and a whole-system approach to investigate ecosystem responses to environmental changes. We use spiralling metrics to examine how the coupling of nitrogen and phosphorus uptake varies between streams dominated by either heterotrophic (i.e. bacteria-dominated) or autotrophic (algal-dominated) microbial communities. 2. Algae generally exhibit greater capacity to store nutrients than bacteria because of differences in cellular structures. These differences led us to hypothesise that the uptake of N and P in heterotrophic ecosystems should have reduced stoichiometric variation in response to changes in supply N:P compared to autotrophic ecosystems when assimilation dominates nutrient uptake. 3. To test this hypothesis, we used an array of serial nutrient additions in several streams in the South Fork Eel River watershed in Northern California. In one set of experiments, N and P were added alone and simultaneously in separate experiments to two small, heterotrophic streams to assess uptake rates and interactions between nutrient cycles. In a second set of experiments, N and P were added simultaneously at a range of N:P in one heterotrophic and one autotrophic stream to assess differences in uptake responses to changes in supply N:P. 4. Results of these experiments suggest two important conclusions. First, increased N supply significantly shortened P uptake lengths, while P addition had little impact on N uptake in both streams, indicating that uptake of non-limiting nutrients is tightly coupled to the availability of the limiting element. Second, changes in P uptake and uptake ratios (UN:UP) with increased supply N:P supported our hypothesis that heterotrophic streams are more homeostatic in their responses to changes in nutrient supply than autotrophic streams, suggesting that physiological controls on nutrient use scale up to influence ecosystem-scale patterns in nutrient cycling. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

We compared flux esti-mates into and out of the N and P " pipes " and showed the net removal rates of N and P by inland waters were less than those for C. The C : N : P stoichiometry of inland water inputs vs. exports differed due to large respiratory C and N losses, and efficient P burial in inland waters.

abstract = {Stoichiometric analyses can be used to investigate the linkages between N and C cycles and how these linkages influence biogeochemistry at many scales, from components of individual ecosystems up to the biosphere. N-specific NH 4+ uptake rates were measured in eight streams using short-term 15N tracer additions, and C to N ratios (C:N) were determined from living and non-living organic matter collected from ten streams. These data were also compared to previously published data compiled from studies of lakes, ponds, wetlands, forests, and tundra. There was a significant negative relationship between C:N and N-specific uptake rate; C:N could account for 41{\%} of the variance in N-specific uptake rate across all streams, and the relationship held in five of eight streams. Most of the variation in N-specific uptake rate was contributed by detrital and primary producer compartments with large values of C:N and small values for N-specific uptake rate. In streams, particulate materials are not as likely to move downstream as dissolved N, so if N is cycling in a particulate compartment, N retention is likely to be greater. Together, these data suggest that N retention may depend in part on C:N of living and non-living organic matter in streams. Factors that alter C:N of stream ecosystem compartments, such as removal of riparian vegetation or N fertilization, may influence the amount of retention attributed to these ecosystem compartments by causing shifts in stoichiometry. Our analysis suggests that C:N of ecosystem compartments can be used to link N-cycling models across streams. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

abstract = {[1] Over the past 3 decades, nutrient spiraling has become a unifying paradigm for stream biogeochemical research. This paper presents ( 1) a quantitative synthesis of the nutrient spiraling literature and ( 2) application of these data to elucidate trends in nutrient spiraling within stream networks. Results are based on 404 individual experiments on ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NO3), and phosphate (PO4) from 52 published studies. Sixty-nine percent of the experiments were performed in first- and second-order streams, and 31{\%} were performed in third- to fifth-order streams. Uptake lengths, S-w, of NH4 (median = 86 m) and PO4 (median = 96 m) were significantly different (alpha = 0.05) than NO3 (median = 236 m). Areal uptake rates of NH4 (median = 28 mu g m(-2) min(-1)) were significantly different than NO3 and PO4 (median = 15 and 14 mu g m(-2) min(-1), respectively). There were significant differences among NH4, NO3, and PO4 uptake velocity (median = 5, 1, and 2 mm min(-1), respectively). Correlation analysis results were equivocal on the effect of transient storage on nutrient spiraling. Application of these data to a stream network model showed that recycling (defined here as stream length divided by S-w) of NH4 and NO3 generally increased with stream order, while PO4 recycling remained constant along a first- to fifth-order stream gradient. Within this hypothetical stream network, cumulative NH4 uptake decreased slightly with stream order, while cumulative NO3 and PO4 uptake increased with stream order. These data suggest the importance of larger rivers to nutrient spiraling and the need to consider how stream networks affect nutrient flux between terrestrial and marine ecosystems.},

While models of riverine fluxes are increasingly good at predicting total annual nutrient loads, our understanding of which features of a watershed differentially affect N and P transport downstream is still limited. In this study, we used linear mixed models to quantify the relative transport of N and P through different landscape and limnoscape compartments (e.g. hill slopes, lakes, reservoirs,) under a variety of climate regimes over 26 years in 18 watersheds of the St. Lawrence Basin. Water retention capacity and precipitation patterns were the features that most strongly influenced nutrient export from land to water, where P was preferentially retained in the landscape over N when water retention capacity was highest. Lakes and reservoirs also emerged as features that influenced nutrient fluxes, where lakes preferentially retain more P over N and reservoirs tended to export N. Factors that favor erosion, such as flashiness of precipitation and land-use change also alter N:P ratios in receiving waters, largely by mobilizing legacy sources of P.},

abstract = {Transient storage (TS) zones are important areas of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) processing in rivers. We assessed sensitivities regarding the relative impact that the main channel (MC), surface TS (STS), and hyporheic TS (HTS) have on network denitrification using a model applied to the Ipswich River in Massachusetts, United States. STS and HTS connectivity and size were parameterized using the results of in situ solute tracer studies in first- through fifth-order reaches. DIN removal was simulated in all compartments for every river grid cell using reactivity derived from Lotic Intersite Nitrogen Experiment (LINX2) studies, hydraulic characteristics, and simulated discharge. Model results suggest that although MC-to-STS connectivity is greater than MC-to-HTS connectivity at the reach scale, at basin scales, there is a high probability of water entering the HTS at some point along its flow path through the river network. Assuming our best empirical estimates of hydraulic parameters and reactivity, the MC, HTS, and STS removed approximately 38{\%}, 21{\%}, and 14{\%} of total DIN inputs during a typical base flow period, respectively. There is considerable uncertainty in many of the parameters, particularly the estimates of reaction rates in the different compartments. Using sensitivity analyses, we found that the size of TS is more important for DIN removal processes than its connectivity with the MC when reactivity is low to moderate, whereas TS connectivity is more important when reaction rates are rapid. Our work suggests a network perspective is needed to understand how connectivity, residence times, and reactivity interact to influence DIN processing in hierarchical river systems.

abstract = {Studies were carried out to assess the influence of nutrients, dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and nickel (Ni) on river biofilm development, structure, function, and community composition. Biofilms were cultivated in rotating annular reactors with river water at a DO concentration of 0.5 or 7.5 mg liter-1, with or without a combination of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus (CNP) and with or without Ni at 0.5 mg liter-1. The effects of Ni were apparent in the elimination of cyanobacterial populations and reduced photosynthetic biomass in the biofilm. Application of lectin-binding analyses indicated changes in exopolymer abundance and a shift in the glycoconjugate makeup of the biofilms, as well as in the response to all treatments. Application of the fluorescent live-dead staining (BacLight Live-Dead staining kit; Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) indicated an increase in the ratio of live to dead cells under low-oxygen conditions. Nickel treatments had 50 to 75{\%} fewer 'live' cells than their corresponding controls. Nickel at 0.5 mg liter-1 corresponding to the industrial release rate concentration for nickel resulted in reductions in carbon utilization spectra relative to control and CNP treatments without nickel. In these cases, the presence of nickel eliminated the positive influence of nutrients on the biofilm. Other culture-dependent analyses (plate counts and most probable number) revealed no significant treatment effect on the biofilm communities. In the presence of CNP and at both DO levels, Ni negatively affected denitrification but had no effect on hexadecane mineralization or sulfate reduction. Analysis of total community DNA indicated abundant eubacterial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), whereas Archaea were not detected. Amplification of the alkB gene indicated a positive effect of CNP and a negative effect of Ni. The nirS gene was not detected in samples treated with Ni at 0.5 mg liter -1, indicating a negative effect on specific populations of bacteria, such as denitrifiers, resulting in a reduction in diversity. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed that CNP had a beneficial impact on biofilm bacterial diversity at high DO concentrations, but none at low DO concentrations, and that the negative effect of Ni on diversity was similar at both DO concentrations. Notably, Ni resulted in the appearance of unique bands in 16S rDNA from Ni, DO, and CNP treatments. Sequencing results confirmed that the bands belonged to bacteria originating from freshwater and marine environments or from agricultural soils and industrial effluents. The observations indicate that significant interactions occur between Ni, oxygen, and nutrients and that Ni at 0.5 mg liter-1 may have significant impacts on river microbial community diversity and function.},

abstract = {Understanding interactions between nutrient cycles is essential for recognizing and remediating human impacts on water quality, yet multielemental approaches to studying nutrient cycling in streams are currently rare. Here we utilized a relatively new approach (tracer additions for spiraling curve characterization) to examine uptake dynamics for three essential nutrients across a landscape that varied in absolute and relative nutrient availability. We measured nutrient uptake for soluble reactive phosphorous, ammonium-nitrogen, and nitrate-nitrogen in 16 headwater streams in the Catskill Mountains, New York. Across the landscape, ammonium-nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus had shorter uptake lengths and higher uptake velocities than nitrate-nitrogen. Ammonium-nitrogen and soluble reactive phosphorus uptake velocities were tightly correlated, and the slope of the relationship did not differ from one, suggesting strong demand for both nutrients despite the high ambient water column dissolved inorganic nitrogen: soluble reactive phosphorus ratios. Ammonium-nitrogen appeared to be the preferred form of nitrogen despite much higher nitrate-nitrogen concentrations. The uptake rate of nitrate-nitrogen was positively correlated with ambient soluble reactive phosphorus concentration and soluble reactive phosphorus areal uptake rate, suggesting that higher soluble reactive phosphorus concentrations alleviate phosphorus limitation and facilitate nitrate-nitrogen uptake. In addition, these streams retained a large proportion of soluble reactive phosphorus, ammonium-nitrogen, and nitrate-nitrogen supplied by the watershed, demonstrating that these streams are important landscape filters for nutrients. Together, these results (1) indicated phosphorus limitation across the landscape but similarly high demand for ammonium-nitrogen and (2) suggested that nitrate-nitrogen uptake was influenced by variability in soluble reactive phosphorus availability and preference for ammonium-nitrogen.},

abstract = {Streams are potential hotspots for retention and removal of NO(3)(-), and understanding the mechanisms that enhance NO(3)(-) reactivity in stream systems is critical for predicting and preventing eutrophication. Both dissolved organic C (DOC) and dissolved O(2) (DO) influence NO(3)(-) removal processes. Assessing the individual impacts of NO(3)(-), DO, and DOC concentrations on stream NO(3)(-) removal is difficult because these factors covary and are coupled through the C and N cycles. We used an experimental approach to quantify the influences of NO(3)(-), DOC, and DO on NO(3)(-) transport in headwater streams of the Ipswich and Parker River watersheds (Massachusetts, USA) with contrasting levels of DOC and DO. In a 1(st) set of experiments, we added NO(3)(-) to address how uptake kinetics differed between a low-DO/high-DOC stream (Cedar Swamp Creek) and a high-DO/low-DOC stream (Cart Creek). In a 2(nd) set of experiments, we manipulated, for the first time at the reach scale, both DO and DOC in a factorial experiment. DO was added to the low-DO stream by injecting O(2) and was removed from the high-DO stream by adding sodium sulfite. DOC was added both alone and in combination with the DO manipulations. NO(3)(-) concentration was an important control of NO(3)(-) uptake velocity in our study streams, consistent with previous findings. The results of the DOC and DO manipulations suggested that DO determines whether a stream has net NO(3)(-) uptake or production and that the presence of DOC magnifies the DO response processes. Addition of DOC by itself did not lead to increased NO(3)(-) uptake. In addition, we observed organic matter priming effects, wherein the addition of labile organic matter resulted in accelerated metabolism of naturally occurring DOC in the water column. Priming effects have not been reported previously in stream systems. Results from our experiments suggest that NO(3)(-) uptake in streams might arise from complex interactions among DOC, DO, and NO(3)(-), and ultimately, from the influence of DO on dominant stream processes.},

abstract = {Data are presented of experiments with turbulent open channel flow over rough surfaces and large relative submergence, which are conducted in two series with different geometric boundary conditions. During the experiments an oscillating fluid motion in the uppermost filter layer is visualised by the injection of a tracer dye. It is shown that this oscillating fluid motion is driven by highly unsteady pressure gradients and contributes to in- and outflow at the interface between surface and subsurface flow, but its intensity decays rapidly with increasing filter depth. About 90{\%} of the high frequency pressure fluctuations measured at the surface of the filter layer are damped at a filter depth of about 4-5 times the average gravel size of the surface of the bed. It is assumed that the considered high frequency oscillations originate from turbulent pressure fluctuations in the near bed layer. The exponential function that fits the decay of turbulent pressure fluctuations implies a length scale of about 12 times the geometric roughness height as dominant wavelength of a turbulent structure, which imposes a pressure fluctuation on a riverbed. The presented results reveal that micro scale advective transport between surface and subsurface flow occurs separate from diffusive effects and should be considered for the transfer of solutes like dissolved oxygen from fresh to subsurface water and its respiration in the uppermost sediment of aquatic beds. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon, DOC, is an important source of carbon for stream heterotrophs. In many systems, bacteria and fungi are carbon limited. Thus, carbon availability may control both the availability and the dynamics of other nutrients (N or P) in heterotrophic systems. To test the interdependence of C and N cycles in forested streams, we continuously added DOC, as potassium acetate, to the stream draining Watershed six at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, New Hampshire, for six weeks during summer 1999. For two months prior to and throughout the addition, we monitored streamwater NO3- and NH4+ concentrations throughout the 70-m upstream reference and the 70-m downstream treatment reaches. We also estimated uptake lengths and uptake rates of NO3- and NH4+ using back-to-back, short-term enrichments in both the treatment and reference reaches. The change in NO3- concentration during the NH4+ addition was used to estimate whole-stream nitrification. Once before the DOC addition and once during the DOC addition we measured denitrification rates and whole-stream respiration in both reaches. In the treatment reach, the increase in labile DOC caused nitrate concentrations to decrease from pretreatment concentrations during the DOC addition. Metabolism was higher in the treatment than in the reference reach during that addition, while metabolism had been similar in the two reaches before the DOC addition. Prior to that addition, uptake lengths for both NO3- and NH4+ were longer in the treatment reach than in the reference reach. During the DOC addition, the uptake lengths for both forms of nitrogen were much shorter in the treatment than in the reference reach. Contrary to expectations, the DOC enrichment did not lead to increased rates of denitrification. The principal effect of DOC enrichment was to stimulate bacterial growth, leading to high respiration and a corresponding increase in the assimilative demand for nitrogen. Results from this experiment demonstrate tight linkages between DOC and nitrogen availability in headwater streams.},

abstract = {Surface waters play a potentially important role in the global carbon balance. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) fluxes are a major transfer of terrestrial carbon to river systems, and the fate of DOC in aquatic systems is poorly constrained. We used a unique combination of spatially distributed sampling of three DOC fractions throughout a river network and modeling to quantify the net removal of terrestrial DOC during a summer base flow period. We found that aquatic reactivity of terrestrial DOC leading to net loss is low, closer to conservative chloride than to reactive nitrogen. Net removal occurred mainly from the hydrophobic organic acid fraction, while hydrophilic and transphilic acids showed no net change, indicating that partitioning of bulk DOC into different fractions is critical for understanding terrestrial DOC removal. These findings suggest that river systems may have only a modest ability to alter the amounts of terrestrial DOC delivered to coastal zones.},

abstract = {We examined the effect of agricultural land use on whole-stream nutrient availability, biofilm standing crop, and biofilm nutrient limitation and uptake in 21 stream locations in southeastern Idaho. Higher stream water concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), but not nitrate (NO3-N) or phosphate (PO4-P), were associated with {\%} agriculture in the watershed. Streambed chlorophyll a (Chl a) and ash free dry weight (AF dry wt) also increased with agricultural land use. Nutrient diffusing substrate (NDS) bioassays, which determine biofilm nutrient limitation, showed that Chl a was NO3-N limited and suppressed by labile DOC, whereas AF dry wt did not respond to either NO3-N or labile DOC additions. Together, the different responses of Chl a and AF dry wt suggest potential competition between biofilm autotrophs and heterotrophs for nutrients or other resources. Nutrient uptake, determined with short-term releases of NO3-N, PO4-P, and DOC (as glucose) showed that NO3-N uptake velocity (Vf) increased with agricultural land use. Despite the N-limited status of biofilms indicated by the NDS results, uptake of NO3-N could not be consistently detected at all locations. The differences in response of biofilm to organic carbon enrichment suggests a difference in DOC quality, with labile DOC added with NDS compared to perhaps less-labile DOC found in-stream. Linking the interactive responses of biofilm communities to altered nutrient availability is an important step toward understanding whole ecosystem responses to land-use change.},

abstract = {The transport of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in wetlands was investigated in the Yeyahu National Preserve of Beijing, China, from July to December 2011. Stable isotope of nitrogen (15N) as NH4+ was added to experimental mesocosms vegetated by sevfile:///Users/Jancoba/Downloads/s41598-019-53703-3.pdfen common wetland plants. The 15N abundance in soil and various plant parts were measured at prescribed time intervals during the 49-day experimental period. Rapid 15N enrichments were found in soil and aquatic plants during the first sampling event at day 3 and typically increased linearly during the experimental period. Highest 15N enrichment was found in submerged plants, followed by emergent plants and soil. No differences in $\delta$15N values were found among leaves and stems of all submerged plants (Potamogeton pusillus, Potamogeton perfoliatus, Najas marina, Ceratophyllum demersum), suggesting that these plant structures are equally effective in nitrogen assimilation. The roots of P. perfoliatus displayed the lowest enrichment compared to the stems and leaves. Such results indicate that submerged plant roots may have a relatively weak role in nitrogen assimilation. The two emergent plants (Phragmites australis and Typha orientalis) showed no differences in $\delta$15N values among all plant parts, suggesting rapid translocation of nitrogen from roots to other portions. This experiment demonstrates that wetland soil and plant stems and leaves are major sinks for dissolved nitrogen from the surface water and provides valuable insight into nitrogen retention and transport pathways in various wetland plants. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {Climate change is expected to affect hydrologic and thermal regimes of river ecosystems. During dry periods when river flows decrease and water temperatures increase, the hyporheic zone (HZ) can provide a refuge to surface aquatic invertebrates and enhance the resilience capacity of riverine ecosystems. However, shifts from up- to downwelling flow conditions in the HZ could jeopardise this capacity. Using laboratory mesocosms and high-resolution fibre-optic distributed temperature sensing, we explored the combined effects of five different increased surface water temperature treatments (from 15 to 27°C at 3°C intervals) and the direction of water exchange on the ability of Gammarus pulex (Crustacea: Amphipoda: Gammaridae) to migrate into the HZ as a response to warming. We determined the survival rates of this ubiquitous hyporheic dweller and its rates of consumption of alder (Alnus glutinosa; Betulaceae) leaf litter in the HZ. Results showed that at increasing surface water temperature, leaf-litter breakdown was observed at a greater depth in the sediments under downwelling flow conditions, that is, G. pulex migrated deeper into the HZ compared with upwelling conditions, resulting in greater survival rates (64 ± 11 vs. 44 ± 10{\%}). However, under both upwelling and downwelling conditions, we found evidence for potential use of the hyporheic zone as a thermal refuge for G. pulex. Below sediment depths of 25 cm, temperatures remained low ({\textless}22°C) even when surface waters were at 27°C, so temperatures deep in the hyporheic zone never exceeded critical thermal thresholds for G. pulex. This study provides evidence that alterations to the direction of groundwater–surface water exchange can alter the capacity of the HZ to provide a refuge for benthic invertebrates, thereby affecting the resilience of river communities to warming under climate change.},

abstract = {A mesocosm experiment was performed to study benthic-pelagic coupling under a eutrophication gradient. Nine mesocosms were deployed in the facilities of the Hellenic Center for Marine Research in Crete, in the Eastern Mediterranean. The mesocosms were 4 m deep, containing 1.5 m 3 of coastal water and, at the bottom, they included 85 l of undisturbed sediment, collected from a semi-impacted area in the port of Heraklion, Crete. A eutrophication gradient was created by adding nutrients in the water column (Low and High) and the experiment lasted 58 days. Water column and sediment environmental variables were measured at regular intervals. The results indicate that sedimentation caused by eutrophication in the water column affected sediment geochemical variables but in most cases a time lag was observed between the trophic status of the water column and the response of the sediment. Additionally, in the High eutrophication treatment, several fluctuations were observed and the system did not recover within the experimental duration, as opposed to the Low treatment which showed fewer fluctuations and signs of recovery.},

abstract = {Transient storage (TS) zones are important areas of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) processing in rivers. We assessed sensitivities regarding the relative impact that the main channel (MC), surface TS (STS), and hyporheic TS (HTS) have on network denitrification using a model applied to the Ipswich River in Massachusetts, United States. STS and HTS connectivity and size were parameterized using the results of in situ solute tracer studies in first- through fifth-order reaches. DIN removal was simulated in all compartments for every river grid cell using reactivity derived from Lotic Intersite Nitrogen Experiment (LINX2) studies, hydraulic characteristics, and simulated discharge. Model results suggest that although MC-to-STS connectivity is greater than MC-to-HTS connectivity at the reach scale, at basin scales, there is a high probability of water entering the HTS at some point along its flow path through the river network. Assuming our best empirical estimates of hydraulic parameters and reactivity, the MC, HTS, and STS removed approximately 38{\%}, 21{\%}, and 14{\%} of total DIN inputs during a typical base flow period, respectively. There is considerable uncertainty in many of the parameters, particularly the estimates of reaction rates in the different compartments. Using sensitivity analyses, we found that the size of TS is more important for DIN removal processes than its connectivity with the MC when reactivity is low to moderate, whereas TS connectivity is more important when reaction rates are rapid. Our work suggests a network perspective is needed to understand how connectivity, residence times, and reactivity interact to influence DIN processing in hierarchical river systems.

@article{Loken2018,
abstract = {The Mississippi River and other large rivers have the potential to regulate nitrogen export from terrestrial landscapes, and thus mitigate eutrophication in downstream aquatic ecosystems. In large rivers, human-constructed impoundments and connected backwaters may facilitate nitrogen removal; however, the capacity of these features is poorly quantified and incompletely incorporated into model frameworks. Using a high-resolution and spatially intensive sampling technique, we assessed the contribution of individual navigation pools, as well as impounded open waters and backwater wetlands within them, to overall nitrate retention by mapping the entire length (1370 km) of the Upper Mississippi River (UMR) main channel. Based on this single spatial survey of water chemistry, the river appeared to act primarily as a passive nitrate transporter, retaining only 12.5{\%} of the incoming load, most of which occurred in the upper 150 km of the river, which includes the largest and only naturally impounded reach of the river. Although reservoirs typically are nitrogen sinks, our data indicate that UMR dams do not impede river flows to the extent necessary to promote substantial changes in water residence times and subsequent nitrogen removal. Backwaters routinely had lower nitrate concentrations than the main channel, but their limited hydrologic connectivity to the through-flowing river channel constrained their influence on downstream export. As a whole, the UMR did not remove a substantial proportion of its nitrate load despite optimal N removal conditions, numerous impoundments, and the presence of extensive backwater habitats. These results suggest that efforts to reduce delivery of nitrogen to the Gulf of Mexico should emphasize mitigation strategies that target upland nutrient sources rather than relying on removal within the Mississippi River.},

abstract = {Stream ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling may vary with stream position in the network. Using a scaling approach, we examined the relationship between stream size and nutrient uptake length, which represents the mean distance that a dissolved solute travels prior to removal from the water column. Ammonium (NH4+) uptake length increased proportionally with stream size measured as specific discharge (discharge/stream width) with a scaling exponent Combining double low line 1.01. In contrast, uptake lengths for nitrate (NO3{\&}minus;) and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) increased more rapidly than increases in specific discharge (scaling exponents Combining double low line 1.19 for NO3{\&}minus; and 1.35 for SRP). Additionally, the ratio of inorganic nitrogen (N) uptake length to SRP uptake length declined with stream size; there was relatively lower demand for SRP compared to N as stream size increased. Finally, we related the scaling of uptake length with specific discharge to that of stream length using Hack's law and downstream hydraulic geometry. Ammonium uptake length increased less than proportionally with distance from the headwaters, suggesting a strong role for larger streams and rivers in regulating nutrient transport. {\textcopyright} 2013 Author(s).},

abstract = {In many aquatic ecosystems, most microbes live in matrix-enclosed biofilms and contribute substantially to energy flow and nutrient cycling. Little is known, however, about the coupling of structure and dynamics of these biofilms to ecosystem function. Here we show that microbial biofilms changed the physical and chemical microhabitat and contributed to ecosystem processes in 30-m-long stream mesocosms. Biofilm growth increased hydrodynamic transient storage-streamwater detained in quiescent zones, which is a major physical template for ecological processes in streams-by 300{\%} and the retention of suspended particles by 120{\%}. In addition, by enhancing the relative uptake of organic molecules of lower bioavailability, the interplay of biofilm microarchitecture and mass transfer changed their downstream linkage. As living zones of transient storage, biofilms bring hydrodynamic retention and biochemical processing into close spatial proximity and influence biogeochemical processes and patterns in streams. Thus, biofilms are highly efficient and successful ecological communities that may also contribute to the influence that headwater streams have on rivers, estuaries and even oceans through longitudinal linkages of local biogeochemical and hydrodynamic processes.},

abstract = {Agricultural and urban development alters nitrogen and other biogeochemical cycles in rivers worldwide. Because such biogeochemical processes cannot be measured empirically across whole river networks, simulation models are critical tools for understanding river-network biogeochemistry. However, limitations inherent in current models restrict our ability to simulate biogeochemical dynamics among diverse river networks. We illustrate these limitations using a river-network model to scale up in situ measures of nitrogen cycling in eight catchments spanning various geophysical and land-use conditions. Our model results provide evidence that catchment characteristics typically excluded from models may control river-network biogeochemistry. Based on our findings, we identify important components of a revised strategy for simulating biogeochemical dynamics in river networks, including approaches to modeling terrestrial-aquatic linkages, hydrologicexchanges between the channel, floodplain/riparian complex, and subsurface waters, and interactions between coupled biogeochemical cycles. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},
