abstract = {Abstract Watersheds are three-dimensional hydrologic systems where the longitudinal expansion/contraction of stream networks, vertical connection/disconnection between shallow and deep groundwater systems, and lateral connectivity of these water sources to streams mediate runoff production and nutrient export. The connectivity of runoff source areas during both baseflow and stormflow conditions and their combined influence on biogeochemical fluxes remain poorly understood. Here we focused on a set of 3.3 and 48.4 ha nested watersheds (North Carolina, USA). These watersheds comprise ephemeral and intermittent runoff-producing headwaters and perennial runoff-producing lowlands. Within these landscape elements, we characterized the timing and magnitude of precipitation, runoff, and runoff-generating flow paths. The active surface drainage network (ASDN) reflected connectivity to, and contributions from, source areas that differed under baseflow and stormflow conditions. The baseflow-associated ASDN expanded and contracted seasonally, driven by the rise and fall of the seasonal water table. Superimposed on this were event-activated source area contributions driven by connectivity to surficial and shallow subsurface flow paths. Frequently activated shallow flow paths also caused increased in-stream dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations with increases in runoff across both watershed scales. The spread and variability within this DOC-runoff relationship was driven by a seasonal depletion of DOC from continual shallow subsurface flow path activation and subsequent replenishment from autumn litterfall. Our findings suggest that hydrobiogeochemical signals at larger watershed outlets can be driven by the expansion, contraction, and connection of lateral, longitudinal, and vertical source areas with distinct runoff generation processes.},

This article in- troduces a new satellite-driven monitor of the global biosphere that regularly computes daily gross primary production (GPP) and annual net pri- mary production (NPP) at 1-kilometer (km) resolution over 109,782,756 km2 of vegetated land surface.We summarize the history of global NPP science, as well as the derivation of this calculation, and current data production activity. The first data on NPP from the EOS (Earth Observing System) MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor are presented with different types of validation.We offer examples of how this new type of data set can serve ecological science, land management, and environmental policy. To enhance the use of these data by non- specialists, we are now producing monthly anomaly maps for GPP and annual NPP that compare the current value with an 18-year average value for each pixel, clearly identifying regions where vegetation growth is higher or lower than normal.},

@article{Larsen2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 The Authors Limnology and Oceanography published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography Carbon fixation and respiration in flowing waterways play significant roles in global and regional carbon budgets, yet how land use and watershed management interact with temporal disturbances (storms) to influence metabolism remains poorly understood. Here, we combine long-term with synoptic sampling of metabolism and its variable controls in neighboring watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay to resolve limiting factors and critical timescales associated with recovery from disturbance. We found that, relative to predictions of the river continuum concept, focal streams have “disrupted” carbon cycles, with carbon balances closer to zero, and, in some cases, tighter coupling between gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER), attributable to carbon limitation. Carbon became limiting to ER where flashy storm hydrographs and simplified channel geomorphology inhibited accumulation of fine sediment. Shannon entropy analysis of timescales revealed that fine sediment served as a time-release capsule for nutrients and carbon over 4–6 months, fueling biogeochemical transformations. Loss of fines through hydraulic disturbance had up to 30-d impacts on GPP and 50-d impacts on ER in the stream with carbon limitation. In contrast, where GPP and ER were not tightly coupled, recovery occurred within 1 d. Results suggest that a complex interplay between nutrient and carbon limitation and mechanical and chemical disturbance governs patterns and consequences of disrupted carbon cycling in urban streams. Carbon limitation and tight GPP/ER coupling enhance the vulnerability of stream ecosystem functions, but best management practices that target stormflow reduction and channel geomorphic diversity can break that coupling and minimize carbon cycle disruptions.},

abstract = {Simple nitrogen (N) input/output balance calculations in agricultural systems are used to evaluate performance of nutrient management; however, they generally rely on extensive assumptions that do not consider leaching, denitrification, or annual depletion of soil N. We constructed a relatively complete N mass balance for the Big Ditch watershed, an extensively tile-drained agricultural watershed in east-central Illinois. We conducted direct measurements of a wide range of N pools and fluxes for a 2-yr period, including soil N mineralization, soybean N(2) fixation, tile and river N loads, and ground water and in-stream denitrification. Fertilizer N inputs were from a survey of the watershed and yield data from county estimates that were combined with estimated protein contents to obtain grain N. By using maize fertilizer recovery and soybean N(2) fixation to estimate total grain N derived from soil, we calculated the explicit change in soil N storage each year. Overall, fertilizer N and soybean N(2) fixation dominated inputs, and total grain export dominated outputs. Precipitation during 2001 was below average (78 cm), whereas precipitation in 2002 exceeded the 30-yr average of 97 cm; monthly rainfall was above average in April, May, and June of 2002, which flooded fields and produced large tile and riverine N loads. In 2001, watershed inputs were greater than outputs, suggesting that carryover of N to the subsequent year may occur. In 2002, total inputs were less than outputs due to large leaching losses and likely substantial field denitrification. The explicit change in soil storage (67 kg N ha(-1)) offsets this balance shortfall. Although 2002 was climatically unusual, with current production trends of greater maize grain yields with less fertilizer N, soil N depletion is likely to occur in maize/soybean rotations, especially in years with above-average precipitation or extremely wet spring periods.},

abstract = {1. Single-station diel oxygen curves were used to monitor the oxygen metabolism of an intermittent, forested third-order stream (Fuirosos) in the Mediterranean area, over a period of 22 months. Ecosystem respiration (ER) and gross primary production (GPP) were estimated and related to organic matter inputs and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in order to understand the effect of the riparian forest on stream metabolism. 2. Annual ER was 1690 g O2 m-2 year-1 and annual GPP was 275 g O 2 m-2 year-1. Fuirosos was therefore a heterotrophic stream, with P:R ratios averaging 0.16. 3. GPP rates were relatively low, ranging from 0.05 to 1.9 g O2 m-2 day -1. The maximum values of GPP occurred during a few weeks in spring, and ended when the riparian canopy was fully closed. The phenology of the riparian vegetation was an important determinant of light availability, and consequently, of GPP. 4. On a daily scale, light and temperature were the most important factors governing the shape of photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I) curves. Several patterns could be generalised in the P-I relationships. Hysteresis-type curves were characteristic of late autumn and winter. Light saturation responses (that occurred at irradiances higher than 90 $\mu$E m-2 s-1) were characteristic of early spring. Linear responses occurred during late spring, summer and early autumn when there was no evidence of light saturation. 5. Rates of ER were high when compared with analogous streams, ranging from 0.4 to 32 g O2 m-2 day-1. ER was highest in autumn 2001, when organic matter accumulations on the streambed were extremely high. By contrast, the higher discharge in autumn 2002 prevented these accumulations and caused lower ER. The Mediterranean climate, and in its effect the hydrological regime, were mainly responsible for the temporal variation in benthic organic matter, and consequently of ER.},

abstract = {Inland water ecosystems dynamically process, transport, and sequester carbon. However, the transport of carbon through aquatic environments has not been quantitatively integrated in the context of terrestrial ecosystems. Here, we present the first integrated assessment, to our knowledge, of freshwater carbon fluxes for the conterminous United States, where 106 (range: 71–149) teragrams of carbon per year (TgC⋅y−1) is exported downstream or emitted to the atmosphere and sedimentation stores 21 (range: 9–65) TgC⋅y−1 in lakes and reservoirs. We show that there is significant regional variation in aquatic carbon flux, but verify that emission across stream and river surfaces represents the dominant flux at 69 (range: 36–110) TgC⋅y−1 or 65{\%} of the total aquatic carbon flux for the conterminous United States. Comparing our results with the output of a suite of terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs), we suggest that within the current modeling framework, calculations of net ecosystem production (NEP) defined as terrestrial only may be overestimated by as much as 27{\%}. However, the internal production and mineralization of carbon in freshwaters remain to be quantified and would reduce the effect of including aquatic carbon fluxes within calculations of terrestrial NEP. Reconciliation of carbon mass–flux interactions between terrestrial and aquatic carbon sources and sinks will require significant additional research and modeling capacity.},

abstract = {Observation of surface water is a functional requirement for studying ecological and hydrological processes. Recent advances in satellite-based optical remote sensors have promoted the field of sensing surface water to a new era. This paper reviews the current status of detecting, extracting, and monitoring surface water using optical remote sensing, especially progress in the last decade. It also discusses the current status and challenges in this field, including spatio-temporal scale issues, integration with in situ hydrological data and elevation data, obscuration caused by clouds and vegetation, and the growing need to map surface water at a global scale. Historically, sensors have exhibited a contradiction in resolutions. Techniques including pixel unmixing and reconstruction, and spatio-temporal fusion have been developed to alleviate this contradiction. Spatio-temporal dynamics of surface water have been modeled by combining remote sensing data with in situ river flow. Recent studies have also demonstrated that the river discharge can be estimated using only optical remote sensing imagery, providing valuable information for hydrological studies in ungauged areas. Another historical issue for optical sensors has been obscuration by clouds and vegetation. An effective approach of reducing this limitation is to combine with synthetic aperture radar data. Digital elevation model data have also been employed to eliminate cloud/terrain shadows. The development of big data and cloud computation techniques makes the increasing demand of monitoring global water dynamics at high resolutions easier to achieve. An integrated use of multisource data is the future direction for improved global and regional water monitoring. Plain Language Summary Observing surface water is essential for ecological and hydrological studies. This paper reviews the current status of detecting, extracting, and monitoring surface water using optical remote sensing, especially progress in the last decade. It also discusses the current status and challenges in this field. For example, it was found that pixel unmixing and reconstruction, and spatio-temporal fusion are two common and low-cost approaches to enhance surface water monitoring. Remote sensing data have been integrated with in situ river flow to model spatio-temporal dynamics of surface water. Recent studies have also proved that the river discharge can be estimated using only optical remote sensing imagery. This will be a breakthrough for hydrological studies in ungauged areas. Optical sensors are also easily obscured by clouds and vegetation. This limitation can be reduced by integrating optical data with synthetic aperture radar data and digital elevation model data. There is increasing demand of monitoring global water dynamics at high resolutions. It is now easy to achieve with the development of big data and cloud computation techniques. Enhanced global or regional water monitoring in the future requires integrated use of multiple sources of remote sensing data.},

abstract = {The 2010 Church's Park Fire burned beetle-killed lodgepole pine stands in Colorado, including recently salvage-logged areas, creating a fortuitous opportunity to compare the effects of salvage logging, wildfire and the combination of logging followed by wildfire. Here, we examine tree regeneration, surface fuels, understory plants, inorganic soil nitrogen and water infiltration in uncut and logged stands, outside and inside the fire perimeter. Subalpine fir recruitment was abundant in uncut, unburned, beetle-killed stands, whereas lodgepole pine recruitment was abundant in cut stands. Logging roughly doubled woody fuel cover and halved forb and shrub cover. Wildfire consumed all conifer seedlings in uncut and cut stands and did not stimulate new conifer regeneration within four years of the fire. Aspen regeneration, in contrast, was relatively unaffected by logging or burning, alone or combined. Wildfire also drastically reduced cover of soil organic horizons, fine woody fuels, graminoids and shrubs relative to unburned, uncut areas; moreover, the compound effect of logging and wildfire was generally similar to wildfire alone. This case study documents scarce conifer regeneration but ample aspen regeneration after a wildfire that occurred in the later stage of a severe beetle outbreak. Salvage logging had mixed effects on tree regeneration, understory plant and surface cover and soil nitrogen, but neither exacerbated nor ameliorated wildfire effects on those resources.},

We then assessed CO{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}production from aquatic metabolism, compiled from previously published measurements of net ecosystem production from 187 streams and rivers across the contiguous United States.

abstract = {Hydrological controls on DOC and N transport at the catchment scale were studied for five storm events from the fall of 2004 through the spring of 2005 in WS10, H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest in the western Cascade Mountains of Oregon. This catchment is devoid of any riparian zone and characterized by hillslopes that issue directly into the stream. This enabled us to compare a trenched hillslope response to the stream response without the influence of riparian zone mixing. DOC and N concentrations and dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality (specific UV-absorbance (SUVA) and C:N of DOM) were investigated at the plot scale, in lateral subsurface flow from the trenched hillslope and stream water at the catchment outlet at the annual and seasonal scale (transition vs. wet period) during baseflow and stormflow conditions. DON was the dominant form of total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in all sampled solutions, except in transient groundwater, where DIN was the dominant form. Organic horizon leachate and transient groundwater were characterized by high SUVA, and high DOC and total N concentrations, while SUVA and DOC and DON concentrations in lysimeters decreased with depth in the soil profile. This suggests vertical preferential flow without much soil matrix interaction occurred at the site. Deep groundwater (from a spring at the base of the hillslope) was characterized by low SUVA and low DOC and N concentrations. SUVA was always lower in lateral subsurface flow than in stream water at the seasonal scale, even during the wet period when other solutes were similar between lateral subsurface flow and stream water. This suggested mixing of deep groundwater and shallow transient groundwater was different at the hillslope scale compared to the catchment scale. DOC and DON sources were finite (production of DOC and DON from the hillslope soils appeared to be limited) at the seasonal scale since DOC and DON concentrations were significantly lower during the wet period compared to the transition period during stormflow conditions. This was also reflected in the DOC and DON peak and flow weighted storm event concentrations and antecedent soil moisture relationship where drier conditions (less prior flushing) resulted in the highest DOC and DON peak and flow weighted storm event concentrations. Results from this study showed the importance of the hillslope component in DOC and N transport at the catchment scale and underscore the importance of sampling solutes below the root zone (transient groundwater) and the value of using SUVA to fingerprint DOC sources. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd/CNRS. Carbon and nitrogen cycles are coupled through both stoichiometric requirements for microbial biomass and dissimilatory metabolic processes in which microbes catalyse reduction-oxidation reactions. Here, we integrate stoichiometric theory and thermodynamic principles to explain the commonly observed trade-off between high nitrate and high organic carbon concentrations, and the even stronger trade-off between high nitrate and high ammonium concentrations, across a wide range of aquatic ecosystems. Our results suggest these relationships are the emergent properties of both microbial biomass stoichiometry and the availability of terminal electron acceptors. Because elements with multiple oxidation states (i.e. nitrogen, manganese, iron and sulphur) serve as both nutrients and sources of chemical energy in reduced environments, both assimilative demand and dissimilatory uses determine their concentrations across broad spatial gradients. Conceptual and quantitative models that integrate rather than independently examine thermodynamic, stoichiometric and evolutionary controls on biogeochemical cycling are essential for understanding local to global biogeochemical patterns.},

We use the expression nutrient dynamics for Studies that Included some measures of biological processes occurring within streams Prior to the 1970s, instream biological processes were little studied, but through 1985 conceptual advances were made, and 4 types of studies made important contributions to Our understanding of instream processes 1) evidence of increased plant production and decomposition in response to nutrient addition, 2) studies showing a downstream decrease in nutrient concentrations, 3) studies using radioisotopes, and 4) budget studies Beginning with the first paper printed in its first Issue, J-NABS has been the outlet for key papers advancing our understanding of rates and controls of nutrient dynamics in streams. In the first few years, an important review and a conceptual model for conducting experiments to study nutrient dynamics in streams were published in J-NABS In the 1990s, J-NABS published a number of papers on nutrient recycling within algal communities, the role of the hyporheic zone, the role of spawning fish, and the coupling of data from field N-15 additions and a N-cycling model to provide a synoptic view of N dynamics in streams Since 2000, J-NABS has published influential studies on nutrient criteria for streams, rates of and controls on nitrification and denitrification, uptake of stream nutrients by riparian vegetation, and nutrient dynamics in urban streams Nutrient dynamics will certainly continue to be an important topic in J-NABS Topics needing further study include. techniques for study in nutrient dynamics, nutrient dynamics in larger streams and rivers, the ultimate fate of nutrients taken up by plants and microbes in streams, ecological stoichiometry, the effects of climate change, and the role of streams and rivers in nutrient transformation and retention at the landscape scale.},

Most nutrient spiraling studies use models that aggregate the influence of the various transient storage zones on uptake and retention. This may explain contradictory results on drivers of nutrient cycling in streams. Here, a new two-storage zone transport model with Michaelis–Menten uptake kinetics was developed to quantify the relative role of the three stream compartments on the physical and biological transport of solutes and compared with a dynamic nutrient spiraling method (tracer additions for spiraling curve characterization). Both approaches are applied to coinjected conservative and reactive tracer tests in a stream with mean annual discharge {\textgreater}1.0 m3 s−1. The relative influence of the three stream compartments on in-stream uptake of NO3-N varied between reaches; each stream compartment dominated overall nitrate uptake in at least one subreach. HTS zones generally had greater influence on nitrate concentrations than STS zones because of longer residence times and faster uptake rates. However, a combination of geomorphology, MC-transient storage connectivity, residence time, compartment size, and uptake rate controls overall nutrient uptake capacity of a stream. Overall reach and compartment-specific uptake and uptake efficiency benefit from the upstream action of the transient storage zones during nutrient addition experiments, but STS and HTS contribute in different ways. Physical retention and biological uptake in STS zones contributed equally to overall reach uptake, but biological uptake in HTS zones overshadowed physical retention.},

abstract = {Stream metabolism is a fundamental, integrative indicator of aquatic ecosystem functioning. However, it is not well understood how heterogeneity in physical channel form, particularly in relation to and caused by in‐stream woody debris, regulates stream metabolism in lowland streams. We combined conservative and reactive stream tracers to investigate relationships between patterns in stream channel morphology and hydrological transport (form) and metabolic processes as characterized by ecosystem respiration (function) in a forested lowland stream at baseflow. Stream reach‐scale ecosystem respiration was related to locations (“hotspots”) with a high abundance of woody debris. In contrast, nearly all other measured hydrological and geomorphic variables previously documented or hypothesized to influence stream metabolism did not significantly explain ecosystem respiration. Our results suggest the existence of key differences in physical controls on ecosystem respiration between lowland stream systems (this study) and smaller upland streams (most previous studies) under baseflow conditions. As such, these findings have implications for reactive transport models that predict biogeochemical transformation rates from hydraulic transport parameters, for upscaling frameworks that represent biological stream processes at larger network scales, and for the effective management and restoration of aquatic ecosystems.},

During sunny periods, trees transpire deoxygenated water from roots to the canopy but not in the dark, resulting in diurnal cycles of dissolved oxygen. Whole- stream shading experiments showed that photosynthesis in the stream is not responsible for the pattern. Sealed chamber measurements showed living roots of riparian vegetation had substantial respiratory activity and ammonium and nitrate uptake, and rates per unit area were greater than sand and less than silt (the other two dominant substrata), indicating roots can substantially alter in-stream biogeochemistry.},

abstract = {Stream metabolism is affected by both natural and human-induced processes. While metabolism has multiple implications for ecological processes, relatively little is known about how metabolic rates are influenced by land use in tropical streams. In this study, we assessed the metabolic characteristics and related environmental factors of six streams located in a transition area from Cerrado to Atlantic Forest (S{\~{a}}o Carlos/Brazil). Three streams were relatively preserved, while three were flowing through more agriculturally and/or urban impacted watersheds. Surface water samples were analyzed for biological and physico-chemical parameters as well as discharge and percentage of canopy cover. Metabolism was determined through the single-station method to estimate gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and net ecosystem production (NEP) with BAyesian Single-station Estimation (BASE). Nutrient concentrations tended to be higher in impacted versus preserved streams (e.g., average total phosphorus between 0.028-0.042 mg L-1 and 0.009-0.038 mg L-1, respectively). Average canopy cover varied between 58 and 77{\%}, with no significant spatial or seasonal variation. All streams were net heterotrophic (ER exceeded GPP) in all sampling periods. GPP rates were always lower than 0.7 gO2 m-2 d-1 in all streams and ER varied from 0.6 to 42.1 gO2 m-2 d-1.  Linear Mixed-Effect models showed that depth, discharge, velocity and total phosphorus are the most important predictors for GPP. For ER, depth, velocity and canopy cover are significant potential predictors. Canopy cover was the main light limiting factor and influenced stream metabolism. Our findings reinforced the concepts that shifts in the shading effect provided by vegetation (e.g., through deforestation) or changes in discharge (e.g., through land use conversion or water abstractions) can impact freshwater metabolism. Our study suggests that human activities in low latitude areas can alter tropical streams' water quality, ecosystem function, and the degree of riparian influence. Our data showed that tropical streams can be especially responsive to increases of organic matter inputs leading to high respiration rates and net heterotrophy, and this should be considered to support management and restoration efforts.},

abstract = {We investigated changes in respiration across nighttime and daytime in a headwater stream. For this, we conducted consecutive nighttime and daytime experiments injecting the bioreactive tracer resazurin in two reaches with different riparian canopy densities (different levels of photosynthetically active radiation) to compare respiration rate coefficients. We found that even though stream water temperatures measured above the streambed at day and night (half-day timescale) were different within each reach and across reaches (95{\%} confidence level), apparent respiration rate coefficients were not different across nighttime and daytime conditions (95{\%} confidence level). A likely explanation for this is that the bulk of stream respiration takes place in the hyporheic zone, where diel fluctuations of stream temperature and photosynthetically active radiation are considerably attenuated and where temperature is not measured in routine investigations of stream metabolism. Our results suggest that community respiration in headwater streams may not need to be ‘corrected' for temperature between daytime and nighttime, even though instantaneous changes in respiration are expected to occur from a pure biological perspective.

This article in- troduces a new satellite-driven monitor of the global biosphere that regularly computes daily gross primary production (GPP) and annual net pri- mary production (NPP) at 1-kilometer (km) resolution over 109,782,756 km2 of vegetated land surface.We summarize the history of global NPP science, as well as the derivation of this calculation, and current data production activity. The first data on NPP from the EOS (Earth Observing System) MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor are presented with different types of validation.We offer examples of how this new type of data set can serve ecological science, land management, and environmental policy. To enhance the use of these data by non- specialists, we are now producing monthly anomaly maps for GPP and annual NPP that compare the current value with an 18-year average value for each pixel, clearly identifying regions where vegetation growth is higher or lower than normal.},

How strongly denitrification affects the transport of nitrate (NO(3)-N) in Illinois streams has not been directly assessed. We used the nutrient spiraling model to assess the role of in-stream denitrification in affecting the concentration and downstream transport of NO(3)-N in five headwater streams in agricultural areas of east-central Illinois. Denitrification in stream sediments was measured approximately monthly from April 2001 through January 2002. Denitrification rates tended to be high (up to 15 mg N m(-2) h(-1)), but the concentration of NO(3)-N in the streams was also high ({\textgreater}7 mg N L(-1)). Uptake velocities for NO(3)-N (uptake rate/concentration) were lower than reported for undisturbed streams, indicating that denitrification was not an efficient N sink relative to the concentration of NO(3)-N in the water column. Denitrification uptake lengths (the average distance NO(3)-N travels before being denitrified) were long and indicated that denitrification in the streambed did not affect the transport of NO(3)-N. Loss rates for NO(3)-N in the streams were {\textless}5{\%} d(-1) except during periods of low discharge and low NO(3)-N concentration, which occurred only in late summer and early autumn. Annually, most NO(3)-N in these headwater sites appeared to be exported to downstream water bodies rather than denitrified, suggesting previous estimates of N losses through in-stream denitrification may have been overestimated.},

abstract = {It is increasingly being recognized that global ecological research requires novel methods and strategies in which to combine process-based ecological models and data in cohesive, systematic ways. In process-based model applications, inherent spatial and temporal heterogeneities found within terrestrial ecosystems may lead to the uncertainties of model predictions. To reduce simulation uncertainties due to inaccurate model parameters, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method was applied in this study to improve the estimations of four key parameters used in the process-based ecosystem model of TRIPLEXFLUX. These four key parameters include a maximum photosynthetic carboxylation rate of 25°C (Vmax), an electron transport (Jmax) light-saturated rate within the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle of leaves, a coefficient of stomatal conductance (m), and a reference respiration rate of 10°C (R10). Seven forest flux tower sites located across North America were used to investigate and facilitate understanding of the daily variation in model parameters for three deciduous forests, three evergreen temperate forests, and one evergreen boreal forest. Eddy covariance CO2 exchange measurements were assimilated to optimize the parameters in the year 2006. After parameter optimization and adjustment took place, net ecosystem production prediction significantly improved (by approximately 25{\%}) compared to the CO2 flux measurements taken at the seven forest ecosystem sites. Results suggest that greater seasonal variability occurs in broadleaf forests in respect to the selected parameters than in needleleaf forests. This study also demonstrated that the model-data fusion approach by incorporating MCMC method is able to better estimate parameters and improve simulation accuracy for different ecosystems located across North America.},

abstract = {1. Stream ecosystem metabolism integrates production and respiration of organic matter and plays a fundamental role in the global carbon (C) cycle. Several studies have identified distal and proximal physical controls, for example, land use and transient storage, or the effects of water chemistry, that is, organic matter and nutrient availability, on stream metabolism. In parallel, research on organic matter quality has identified conspicuous gradients of chemical composition, yet mostly without demonstrating any functional implications. 2. We hypothesise that organic matter holds a key position in a more comprehensive causal framework of stream ecosystem metabolism, and that a concurrent study can improve mechanistic understanding. Specifically, we here postulate that dissolved organic matter (DOM) quality, that is, its chemical composition, acts as a control of ecosystem respiration (ER) as much as it is a result of gross primary production (GPP). As such, DOM quality likely forms a central link between land use and stream metabolism, besides known physical controls including transient storage and light availability. 3. To examine these hypotheses, we studied 33 streams in north-eastern Austria, a region with diverse land use ranging from semi-natural, forested areas to agricultural areas and settlements. We analysed DOM composition by absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy, including modelling excitation–emission matrices with parallel factor analysis. We then opposed these data to GPP and ER estimated by fitting a metabolism model to single-station diurnal oxygen records. 4. Structural equation modelling revealed land use as a control on light conditions, DOM composition and concentration and nutrient concentrations, which together ultimately shaped GPP and ER. In particular, humified, coloured and aromatic DOM of predominantly terrestrial origin was prevalent in coniferous forest catchments and increased stream ER. Agricultural and urban areas enriched streams with phosphorous and nitrogen, which increased ER and GPP. Besides nutrients, GPP seemed to be weakly correlated with light availability and – in contrast to our hypothesis – left only a weak imprint on DOM composition. 5. Land-use change is rated as the most pervasive human influence on natural ecosystems and our results highlight its impact on aquatic GPP and ER in streams. To understand the role of inland waters in the global C cycle will require mechanistic understanding of ecosystem metabolism, which notably includes organic matter quality as a hitherto underappreciated key player.},

abstract = {Real-time, continuous, in situ water quality sensors were deployed on a fourth-order Iowa (U.S.) stream draining an agricultural watershed to evaluate key in-stream processes affecting concentrations of nitrate during a 24-day late summer (Aug-Sep) period. Overall, nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentrations declined 0.11 mg L−1 km−1, or about 1.9{\%} km−1 and 35{\%} in total across 18 km. We also calculated stream metabolic rates using in situ dissolved oxygen data and determined stream biotic N demand to be 108-117 mg m−2 day−1. From this, we estimate that 11{\%} of the NO3-N concentration decline measured between two in-situ sensors separated by 2 km was a result of biotic NO3-N demand, while groundwater NO3-N data and estimates of groundwater flow contributions indicate that dilution was responsible for 53{\%}. Because the concentration decline extends linearly across the entire 18 km of stream length, these processes seem consistent throughout the basin downstream of the most upstream sensor site. The nitrate-dissolved oxygen relationship between the two sites separated by 2 km, calculations of biotic NO3-N demand, and diurnal variations in NO3-N concentration all indicate that denitrification by anaerobes is removing less NO3-N than that assimilated by aquatic organisms unable to fix nitrogen for their life processes, and thus the large majority of the NO3-N entering this stream is not retained or removed, but rather transported downstream.

Autotrophic N assimilation estimates derived from diel DO variability and GPP stoichiometry agreed closely with estimates based on integration of diel variation in NO3- concentration, although the correspondence of these metrics depended on the method used to estimate NO3- baselines. In addition, day-to-day changes in nocturnal NO3- concentration maxima were strongly negatively correlated with day-to-day changes in GPP. Diel temperature variation in the Ichetucknee River indicated that this pattern could not be explained by hydrologic dispersion, while relationships between N assimilation and O-2 production at hourly intervals indicated minimal physiological lags. The estimated magnitude of heterotrophic assimilation was small, indicating that the relationship between changes in GPP and changes in nocturnal NO3- maxima reflects sensitivity of denitrification to variation in exudation of labile organic matter by primary producers. We estimate that similar to 35{\%} of denitrification may be fueled by the previous day's photosynthesis; this result is consistent with the broader hypothesis that the magnitude of autochthonous production in aquatic systems influences the fate of N via both direct and indirect mechanisms.}},

Two MODIS vegetation indices (VI), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), are produced at 1-km and 500-m resolutions and 16-day compositing periods. This paper presents an initial analysis of the MODIS NDVI and EVI performance from both radiometric and biophysical perspectives. We utilize a combination of site-intensive and regionally extensive approaches to demonstrate the performance and validity of the two indices. Our results showed a good correspondence between airborne-measured, top-of-canopy reflectances and VI values with those from the MODIS sensor at four intensively measured test sites representing semi-arid grass/shrub, savanna, and tropical forest biomes. Simultaneously derived field biophysical measures also demonstrated the scientific utility of the MODIS VI. Multitemporal profiles of the MODIS VIs over numerous biome types in North and South America well represented their seasonal phenologies. Comparisons of the MODIS-NDVI with the NOAA-14, 1-km AVHRR-NDVI temporal profiles showed that the MODIS-based index performed with higher fidelity. The dynamic range of the MODIS VIs are presented and their sensitivities in discriminating vegetation differences are evaluated in sparse and dense vegetation areas. We found the NDVI to asymptotically saturate in high biomass regions such as in the Amazon while the EVI remained sensitive to canopy variations.},

abstract = {Although recent studies indicate that fluvial systems can be accumulation areas for microplastics (MPs), the common perception still treats rivers and streams primarily as pure transport vectors for MPs. In this study we investigate the occurrence of MPs in a yet unnoticed but essential compartment of fluvial ecosystems - the hyporheic zone (HZ). Larger MP particles (500-5,000 µm) were detected using attenuated total reflectance (ATR) - Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Our analysis of MPs (500-5,000 µm) in five freeze cores extracted for the Roter Main River sediments (Germany) showed that MPs were detectable down to a depth of 0.6 m below the streambed in low abundances (≪1 particle per kg dry weight). Additionally, one core was analyzed as an example for smaller MPs (20-500 µm) with focal plane array (FPA)- based µFTIR spectroscopy. Highest MP abundances ({\~{}}30,000 particles per kg dry weight) were measured for pore scale particles (20-50 µm). The detected high abundances indicate that the HZ can be a significant accumulation area for pore scale MPs (20-50 µm), a size fraction that yet is not considered in literature. As the HZ is known as an important habitat for invertebrates representing the base of riverine food webs, aquatic food webs can potentially be threatened by the presence of MPs in the HZ. Hyporheic exchange is discussed as a potential mechanism leading to a transfer of pore scale MPs from surface flow into streambed sediments and as a potential vector for small MPs to enter the local aquifer. MPs in the HZ therefore may be a potential risk for drinking water supplies, particularly during drinking water production via river bank filtration.},

abstract = {The production of organic carbon by aquatic photosynthesis is a central ecosystem property that influences food webs and nutrient cycling rates. Although it is well known that several factors are related to variation in gross primary production in rivers, it is not known how these factors combine to determine primary productivity at the scale of river networks. Our simulation of river networks at a range of productivity regimes provides an initial approximation of river ecosystem productivity at broad scales, and shows that in some cases, small streams and certain time periods disproportionately influence river network productivity. Abstract High-resolution data are improving our ability to resolve temporal patterns and controls on river productivity, but we still know little about the emergent patterns of primary production at river-network scales. Here, we estimate daily and annual river-network gross primary production (GPP) by applying characteristic temporal patterns of GPP (i.e., regimes) representing distinct river functional types to simulated river networks. A defined envelope of possible productivity regimes emerges at the network-scale, but the amount and timing of network GPP can vary widely within this range depending on watershed size, productivity in larger rivers, and reach-scale variation in light within headwater streams. Larger rivers become more influential on network-scale GPP as watershed size increases, but small streams with relatively low productivity disproportionately influence network GPP due to their large collective surface area. Our initial predictions of network-scale productivity provide mechanistic understanding of the factors that shape aquatic ecosystem function at broad scales.},

abstract = {Spatial variation in fish densities across river networks suggests that the influence of food and habitat resources on assemblages varies greatly throughout watersheds. Conceptual models predict that in situ primary production should vary with river characteristics, but the influence of autochthonous resource availability on the capacity for river reaches to support fish is poorly understood. We estimated primary production throughout the South Fork and Middle Fork of the John Day River, Oregon, by measuring diel cycles in dissolved oxygen (DO) during July 2013. Using these data, we (1) evaluated the extent to which juvenile salmonid abundance and resource limitation correlated with areas of high gross primary production (GPP), (2) developed models to predict GPP from both site-level measurements and remotely sensed data, and (3) made predictions of GPP across the entirety of the Middle Fork John Day River (MFJD) network and assessed the utility of these spatially continuous predictions for describing variation fish densities at broad scales. We produced reliable estimates of GPP at sites where DO loggers were deployed using measurements of solar exposure, water temperature, and conductivity measured at each site, as well as surrogates for these data estimated from remote sensing data sources. Estimates of GPP across fish sampling sites explained, on average, 58-63{\%} of the variation in juvenile salmonid densities during the summer sampling period, and 51-83{\%} during the fall sampling period, while continuous network predictions of GPP explained 44{\%} of the variation in fish densities across 29 km of the MFJD. Further, GPP explained nearly half of the variation in juvenile steelhead dietary resource limitation, as inferred from bioenergetics modeling results. These results comprise a first effort at quantifying variation in autochthonous production across an entire river network and, importantly, provide a much-needed food-web context for guiding more effective fish and habitat management. {\textcopyright} 2018 Saunders et al.},

Evidence for multi-element limitation (i.e., colimitation) of a variety of ecosystem processes is growing rapidly, yet our ability to quantify patterns of coupled nutrient dynamics at the ecosystem level has been hindered by logistical and methodological constraints. Here we quantify coupled nitrogen and phosphorus uptake kinetics in three oligotrophic mountain streams by using novel experimental techniques that quantify colimitation dynamics across a range of nutrient concentrations and stoichiometries. We show that relative demand for NO3-N and PO4-P varied across streams, but that short term availability of one nutrient consistently resulted in elevated, but variable, uptake of the other nutrient at all sites. We used temporally offset, pulsed nutrient additions to parameterize dual-nutrient Michaelis–Menten uptake surface models that represent NO3-N and PO4-P uptake at any given concentration or dissolved NO3-N:PO4-P stoichiometry. Our results indicated that the uptake of N and P were strongly enhanced in the presence of the other nutrient. Surface models quantitatively reflect patterns of colimitation and multi-element demand in streams, and should allow for parameterization of more realistic stream network models that explicitly account for interactions among element cycles.},

Unlike the abrupt biogeochemical changes typical after wildfire and timber harvesting, the outcomes of insect outbreaks are poorly understood. The mountain pine bark beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) began to attack lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) at the Fraser Experimental Forest in 2002 and spread throughout the research area by 2007. We compared streamwater nitrogen (N) from 2003 through 2012 with data from the previous two decades in four watersheds with distinct forest management histories, stand structures, and responses to the beetle outbreak. Watersheds dominated by old-growth had larger trees and lost 85{\%} of overstory pine and 44{\%} of total basal area to bark beetles. In contrast, managed watersheds containing a mixture of second-growth (30–60 year old) and old-growth (250- to 350-year old) had higher density of subcanopy trees, smaller mean tree diameter, and lower bark beetle-induced mortality ({\~{}}26{\%} of total basal area). Streamwater nitrate concentrations were significantly higher in old-growth watersheds during the outbreak than pre-outbreak levels during snowmelt and base flow seasons. In mixed-age stands, streamwater nitrate concentrations were unaffected by the outbreak. Beetle outbreak elevated inorganic N export 43 and 74{\%} in two old-growth watersheds though the amounts of N released in streamwater were low (0.04 and 0.15 kg N ha−1) relative to atmospheric inputs ({\textless}2{\%} of annual N deposition). Increased height, diameter, and foliar N of measured in residual live trees augmented demand for N, far in excess of the change in N export during the outbreak. Reallocation of soil resources released after pine mortality to overstory and understory vegetation helps explain high nutrient retention in watersheds affected by bark beetle outbreaks.},

abstract = {Diel variability in nutrient concentrations is common but not universal in aquatic ecosystems. Theoretical models of photoautotrophic systems attribute the absence of diel uptake variation to nutrient scarcity, such that diel variability in nutrient uptake disappears as nutrients becomes limiting. We tested this prediction in a mesocosm experiment, by exposing benthic algal communities to a range of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus concentrations and recording the rates of uptake during both day and night. We found that higher concentrations of N produced diel variability in uptake, and that the difference between the day and night total mass uptakes approximately equaled N demand for observed primary production as seen in other studies. At lower concentrations of N, uptake rates during the day and night were indistinguishable. These results are the first empirical evidence to imply that diel nitrate Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright.

abstract = {Headwater streams are key sites of nutrient and organic matter processing and retention, but little is known about temporal variability in gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) rates as a result of the short duration of most metabolism measurements in lotic ecosystems. We examined temporal variability and controls on ecosystem metabolism by measuring daily rates continuously for 2 years in Walker Branch, a first-order deciduous forest stream. Four important scales of temporal variability in ecosystem metabolism rates were identified: (1) seasonal, (2) day-to-day, (3) episodic (storm-related), and (4) inter-annual. Seasonal patterns were largely controlled by the leaf phenology and productivity of the deciduous riparian forest. Walker Branch was strongly net heterotrophic throughout the year with the exception of the open-canopy spring when GPP and ER rates were co-equal. Day-to-day variability in weather conditions influenced light reaching the streambed, resulting in high day-to-day variability in GPP particularly during spring (daily light levels explained 84{\%} of the variance in daily GPP in April). Episodic storms depressed GPP for several days in spring, but increased GPP in autumn by removing leaves shading the streambed. Storms depressed ER initially, but then stimulated ER to 2-3 times pre-storm levels for several days. Walker Branch was strongly net heterotrophic in both years of the study, with annual GPP being similar (488 and 519 g O-2 m(-2) y(-1) or 183 and 195 g C m(-2) y(-1)) but annual ER being higher in 2004 than 2005 (-1,645 vs. -1,292 g O-2 m(-2) y(-1) or -617 and -485 g C m(-2) y(-1) supercript stop). Inter-annual variability in ecosystem metabolism (assessed by comparing 2004 and 2005 rates with previous measurements) was the result of the storm frequency and timing and the size of the spring macroalgal bloom. Changes in local climate can have substantial impacts on stream ecosystem metabolism rates and ultimately influence the carbon source and sink properties of these important ecosystems.},

We also detail two advanced methods that can be used to quantify nutrient spiraling within streams using experimental addition approaches: a short-term nutrient release and a15N stable isotope tracer addition. Finally, we describe several modifications to the various methods that could expand their application to various research questions or to allow for customization depending on specific research questions. Understanding the nutrient limitation status and quantifying nutrient uptake in streams is vital because these are key components of ecosystem function, providing information on how streams retain nutrients from watersheds prior to downstream export.},

abstract = {Remote detection and mapping of hydrocarbons (PHCs) in situ in continental areas is still an operational challenge due to the small scale of the occurrences and the mix of spectral signatures of PHCs and mineral substrates in imagery pixels. Despite the increasing development of new technologies, the use of hyperspectral remote sensing data as a complementary tool for both oil exploration and environmental monitoring is not standard in the oil industry, despite its potential. The high spectral resolution of hyperspectral images allows the direct identification of PHCs on the surface and provides valuable information regarding the location and spread of oil spills that can assist in containment and cleanup operations. Combining the spectral information with statistical techniques also offers the potential to improve exploration programs focused on the discovery of new exploration fields through the qualitative and quantitative characterization of oil occurrences in onshore areas. In this scenario, the aim of this work was to develop methods that can assist the detection of continental areas affected by natural oil seeps or leaks (crude oils and fuels). A field experiment was designed by impregnating several mineral substrates with crude oils and fuels in varying concentrations. Simultaneous measurements of soil-PHC combinations were taken using both a hand-held spectrometer and an airborne hyperspectral imager. Classification algorithms were used to directly map the PHCs on the surface. Spectral information was submitted to a PLS (partial least square regression) to create a prediction model for the estimation of the concentrations of PHCs in soils. The developed model was able to detect three impregnation levels (low, intermediate, high), predicting values close to the concentrations used in the experiment. Given the quality of the results in controlled experiments, the methods developed in this research show the potential to support the oil industry in the discovery of new oil plays and reservoirs and to define the contamination stage and spread of oil/fuel in areas affected by accidental leaks, improving both exploration and environmental monitoring.},

These indices have been widely implemented within RS applications using different airborne and satellite platforms with recent advances using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). Up to date, there is no unified mathematical expression that defines all VIs due to the complexity of different light spectra combinations, instrumentation, platforms, and resolutions used. Therefore, customized algorithms have been developed and tested against a variety of applications according to specific mathematical expressions that combine visible light radiation, mainly green spectra region, from vegetation, and nonvisible spectra to obtain proxy quantifications of the vegetation surface. In the real-world applications, optimization VIs are usually tailored to the specific application requirements coupled with appropriate validation tools and methodologies in the ground. The present study introduces the spectral characteristics of vegetation and summarizes the development of VIs and the advantages and disadvantages from different indices developed. This paper reviews more than 100 VIs, discussing their specific applicability and representativeness according to the vegetation of interest, environment, and implementation precision. Predictably, research, and development of VIs, which are based on hyperspectral and UAV platforms, would have a wide applicability in different areas.},

We measured density and leader growth of shade-intolerant lodgepole pine, shade-tolerant Engelmann spruce, and very shade-tolerant subalpine fir regeneration beneath stands that experienced moderate and high overstory lodgepole pine mortality (average 40{\%} and 85{\%} of total basal area) a decade earlier. Lodgepole comprised {\textgreater}90{\%} of the overstory basal area and mature spruce and fir were present in both mortality levels, though live basal area and disturbance history differed. Post-beetle outbreak recruitment was high in both mortality levels, but there were more lodgepole in high than moderate mortality plots (1140 stems ha−1 vs. 60 stems ha−1) and more subalpine fir in moderate than high mortality plots (4690 stems ha−1 vs. 2870 stems ha−1). Pine advance regeneration, established prior to outbreak, was more dense in high mortality than moderate mortality sites (930 stems ha−1 vs. 310 stems ha−1), but the trend was generally the opposite for the other conifers. Lodgepole recruitment increased and subalpine fir decreased with greater forest floor light availability. All species grew faster in high mortality areas than their counterparts in moderate mortality areas. However, in high mortality areas pine grew faster than the more shade tolerant species, and in moderate mortality areas spruce and fir grew faster than pine. These species-specific responses to the degree of overstory mortality will influence future stand composition and rate of forest recovery after mountain pine beetle outbreaks.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Ecology may benefit from long term, large scale experiments on low intensity farming to test theoretical principles and convert them into practical lessons. One century of land conversion in the Argentine pampas, and its effect on critical ecological properties, were analysed and discussed. Land transformation has resulted in significant changes of land use, land cover, energy flow, nutrient dynamics, hydrology, and the trade-offs between productivity, stability and sustainability. The analytical procedure involved the complementary utilisation of different data sources and approaches. The study was focused on large geographical scales: the entire pampas and its five ecoregions. Results were interpreted under the theoretical framework of succession in ecology. The historical conversion of natural grasslands into cultivated grasslands and croplands was not homogeneous, determining a variety of land use and land cover patterns. Due to its higher productivity, much more energy, nutrients and water were mobilised in the rolling pampas than in the other ecoregions. This study provides lessons about how the energy flow, the nutrient dynamics and the hydrological process are modified by land transformation under low external-input conditions. Technical coefficients to be applied in emerging fields of environment administration such as ecological-monitoring, environmental accounting and auditing, agro-ecological certification, land evaluation and allocation, and land management, can also be supplied by this kind of studies.},

This limits our ability to predict the fluvial carbon flux responses to changes in climate and land‐use. We used DOC concentration and discharge patterns with ensemble modelling techniques to quantify DOC flux behavior for 1006 United States watersheds spanning diverse climate and land cover conditions. We found that DOC flux was transport‐limited (concentration increased with discharge) in 80{\%} of watersheds and that this flux behavior spanned ecoregions and watershed sizes. The generality of transport limitation demonstrates how coupling discharge models with widely available watershed properties could allow DOC flux to be efficiently integrated into landscape and earth system models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Vegetation indices have been developed to characterize and extract the Earth's vegetation cover from space using satellite images. For detection of vegetation changes, temporal images are usually independently analyzed or vegetation index differencing is implemented. In this study, a vegetation change index, named normalized difference vegetation change index (NDVCI), was developed to directly detect vegetation changes between two different time images with improved accuracy. The effectiveness of the proposed method to detect vegetation changes was evaluated in comparison with that of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) differencing and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) differencing methods at seven test sites under different environmental conditions in Iran, Malaysia, and Italy. Landsat imagery as one of the most widely used sources of data in remote sensing was used for this purpose. Overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, and omission and commission errors were calculated to assess the accuracy of the resulting change maps. The results demonstrated superiority and higher performance of NDVCI compared to EVI and NDVI differencing for detection of vegetation changes. In five out of the seven test sites, the classification accuracy of NDVCI was higher compared to that of the other methods. In contrast, the results revealed lower accuracy of EVI differencing for vegetation change detection at all the test sites, while NDVI differencing was superior at two of the test sites. In conclusion, the study demonstrated great performance of NDVCI for monitoring vegetation changes at different environmental conditions. Accordingly, this technique may improve the vegetation change detection in future studies.},

abstract = {We studied trends in nutrient cycling and periphyton characteristics (biomass, species composition, productivity, and nutrient content) along longitudinal gradients in laboratory streams to test the hypothesis that upstream-downstream linkages produce distinct longitudinal patterns in stream ecosystems. Periphyton communities were grown under uniform light and now conditions in two 88-m-long laboratory streams created by connecting four channel segments (each 0.3 m wide and 22 m long) in series. At the end of 8 wk, large longitudinal declines in streamwater N and P concentrations were observed in each stream. Although chlorophyll a declined and the proportion of cyanobacteria in the periphyton increased with distance downstream, longitudinal trends in ash-free dry mass, gross primary productivity (GPP), and total respiration were not significant. In contrast, longitudinal trends in most of the parameters related to nutrient deficiency and cycling were significant. Chlorophyll-specific phosphatase activity and C:nutrient ratios in periphyton biomass increased from upstream to downstream, suggesting greater nutrient deficiency downstream. Ratios of net N uptake rate:GPP and net P uptake rate:GPP declined from upstream to downstream, suggesting that nutrient recycling supported a greater fraction of the algal nutrient demand downstream. Ratios of net:total P uptake rate also declined from upstream to downstream suggesting that a larger fraction of the total P uptake from stream water downstream was met by P recycled within the segment rather than by inputs from upstream. Within-segment recycling supplied only 10-25{\%} of P uptake from stream water in upstream segments but contributed 60-70{\%} of the P uptake from stream water in downstream segments. Finally, total P uptake rate:GPP ratio declined from upstream to downstream, suggesting that cycling of P within the periphyton mat was greater downstream than upstream. Together, our results showed that increased nutrient cycling can compensate for longitudinal declines in nutrient concentrations in stream water, preventing large longitudinal changes in periphyton biomass and productivity. Nutrient cycling and algal species composition were the characteristics showing strongest longitudinal linkage in these periphyton-dominated streams, whereas total biomass and productivity patterns were poorly related to longitudinal position.},

abstract = {Nutrient fluxes were investigated on a forested and a clearcut plot in a mixed conifer high elevation (2900 m) forest at the Fraser Experimental Forest in Fraser, Colorado, USA. Plots were located on a coarse loamy mixed Dystric Cryochrept with relatively high base saturation (30-90{\%}) and underlain by an impermeable clay subsoil. Following harvest in late 1984, annual mean NO3 concentrations of 195 to 198 mu mol l(-1) were observed from 1988 through 1990 and concentrations were still above reference levels in 1993. Total nitrogen loss attributable to leaching following harvest was estimated at 48kg ha(-1) over 8 years. Over this same period, atmospheric nitrogen inputs exceeded annual outflow of NH4 plus NO3 from the control plots by approximately 11 kg N ha(-1). A slight enrichment of SO4 and Cl was observed from the harvested plot in 1986 but concentrations later fell below control plot levels, apparently due to dilution by the increased discharge from the harvested plot which was three to four times that from the control plot. Elevated Ca, Mg, and Na concentrations followed a similar pattern to NO3 due to exchange reactions, while a depression in alkalinity of about one-third the amount of NO3 found was also observed. Enrichment of K occurred primarily in water collected at less than 1 m depth. Increases in base cation loss due to leaching after harvest were about twice the amount that can be accounted for by the increased flux of NO3, SO4, and Cl anions. The excess reflects the increased water flux and consequent leaching of base cations in association with HCO3 and organic anions.},

This article in- troduces a new satellite-driven monitor of the global biosphere that regularly computes daily gross primary production (GPP) and annual net pri- mary production (NPP) at 1-kilometer (km) resolution over 109,782,756 km2 of vegetated land surface.We summarize the history of global NPP science, as well as the derivation of this calculation, and current data production activity. The first data on NPP from the EOS (Earth Observing System) MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) sensor are presented with different types of validation.We offer examples of how this new type of data set can serve ecological science, land management, and environmental policy. To enhance the use of these data by non- specialists, we are now producing monthly anomaly maps for GPP and annual NPP that compare the current value with an 18-year average value for each pixel, clearly identifying regions where vegetation growth is higher or lower than normal.},

abstract = {Interactions between multiple disturbances are of special concern in ecology due to their potential for non-linear behavior and long-lasting legacies on landscape structure and function. If multiple disturbances overcome the ecological resilience of a system, alternate stable states are possible. Increases in the frequency and severity of disturbance events as a result of climate change heighten this concern. This study directly addresses the question of ecosystem resilience in the face of multiple disturbances. We investigated a gradient of disturbance interaction severities between two events in a subalpine forest, a 1997 windstorm (variable severity) and a 2002 wildfire (high-severity). A third disturbance, salvage logging of blowdown (19992001) prior to the fire, served as a de facto experimental treatment. Ninety- nine study plots were established across the disturbance gradient, including fire-only areas for a baseline fire response. Modeling indicated that the combination of two severe disturbances created novel conditions which exceeded the resilience mechanisms of the system. Modeled mean fire residence time and temperature (First Order Fire Effects Model, FOFEM), as well as mean distance to potential seed sources, increased as a result of the interaction. Regeneration 8 years post-fire was essentially absent in medium- to high-severity blowdown þ fire plots, whereas low-severity blowdown þ fire and fire-only areas showed strong regeneration. Blowdown þ salvage þ fire had significantly higher regeneration than areas of comparable blowdown, suggesting that fuel loading drove the interaction. CART analysis supported this hypothesis. Multiple disturbances have the potential to create surprising situations and reduce the resilience of an ecosystem. Differential recovery as a result of a novel disturbance created by compounding events will likely have long lasting legacies across the landscape.},

We surveyed the morphology of 26 paired stream reaches in southeastern Pennsylvania, northern Maryland, and Delaware. One member of each pair has a forested riparian zone, whereas the other has a riparian zone composed primarily of grass. The paired reaches are nearly contiguous, so all significant channel-forming variables except riparian vegetation are held constant. The extent of urban development of the watersheds upstream of the paired reaches also varies considerably, allowing us to determine the combined influence of riparian vegetation and urbanization on channel morphology. Statistical analyses indicate that (1) channels with forested riparian zones are wider than channels with nonforested riparian zones, (2) channels in urbanized watersheds are wider than channels in nonurbanized watersheds, and (3) the effect of riparian vegetation is independent of the level of urbanization.},

abstract = {Carbon plays a fundamental role in the flow and transformation of materials within and across all ecosystems. A substan- tial component of the carbon cycle in aquatic ecosystems are the transformations that occur through biological processing, i.e., metabolism. Although the range of aquatic ecosystems in which metabolism has been studied continues to grow, we lack a conceptual framework to connect such studies and to model carbon transformations across broader spatial scales. Here, we present a conceptual and quantitative model that simulates shifts in burial, export, and respiration of persistent and reactive organic carbon pools over water residence times of hours to decades along a continuum of lentic and lotic freshwaters. By integrating aquatic metabolism studies across a range of ecosystem types, we can provide greater mechanis- tic understanding of the controls of carbon fates within and across aquatic ecosystems.},

abstract = {SUMMARY 1. Agriculture is a major contributor of non-point source pollution to surface waters in the midwestern United States, resulting in eutrophication of freshwater aquatic ecosystems and development of hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico. Agriculturally influenced streams are diverse in morphology and have variable nutrient concentrations. Understanding how nutrients are transformed and retained within agricultural streams may aid in mitigating increased nutrient export to downstream ecosystems. 2. We studied six agriculturally influenced streams in Indiana and Michigan to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the factors controlling nutrient retention and export in agricultural streams using nutrient addition and isotopic tracer studies. 3. Metrics of nutrient uptake indicated that nitrate uptake was saturated in these streams whereas ammonium and phosphorus uptake increased with higher concentrations. Phosphorus uptake was likely approaching saturation as evidenced by decreasing uptake velocities with concentration; ammonium uptake velocity also declined with concentra- tion, though not significantly. 4. Higher whole-stream uptake rates of phosphorus and ammonium were associated with the observed presence of stream autotrophs (e.g. algae and macrophytes). However, there was no significant relationship between measures of nutrient uptake and stream metabolism. Water-column nutrient concentrations were positively correlated with gross primary production but not community respiration. 5. Overall, nutrient uptake and metabolism were affected by nutrient concentrations in these agriculturally influenced streams. Biological uptake of ammonium and phosphorus was not saturated, although nitrate uptake did appear to be saturated in these ecosystems. Biological activity in agriculturally influenced streams is higher relative to more pristine streams and this increased biological activity likely influences nutrient retention and transport to downstream ecosystems.},

abstract = {Microbial metabolism couples elemental reactions, driving biogeochemical cycles. Assimilatory coupling of elemental cycles, such as the carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus cycles, occurs when these elements are incorporated into biomass or released through its decomposition. In addition, many microbes are capable of dissimilatory coupling, catalyzing energy-releasing reactions linked to transformations in the oxidation state of elements, and releasing the transformed elements to the environment. Different inorganic elements provide varying amounts of energy yield, and the interaction of these processes creates a microbial energy economy. Dissimilatory reactions involving C, N, iron, and sulfur provide particularly important examples where microbially mediated oxidation-reduction (redox) transformations affect nutrient availability for net primary production, greenhouse-gas emissions, levels of contaminants and natural toxic factors, and other ecosystem dynamics. Recent discoveries of previously unrecognized microbial dissimilatory processes are leading to reevaluation of traditional perceptions of biogeochemical cycles. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

To date, the ability to determine the importance of air–water gas exchange across large spatial scales is hampered partly by our ability to scale the gas transfer velocity and stream hydraulics. Here we report on a metadata analysis of 563 direct gas tracer release experiments that examines scaling laws for the gas transfer velocity. We found that the gas transfer velocity scales with the product of stream slope and velocity, which is in alignment with theory on stream energy dissipation. In addition to providing equations that predict the gas transfer velocity based on stream hydraulics, we used our hydraulic data set to report a new set of hydraulic exponents and coefficients that allow the prediction of stream width, depth, and velocity based on discharge. Finally, we report a new table of gas Schmidt number dependencies to allow researchers to estimate a gas transfer velocity using our equation for many gasses of interest.},

Theoretical models of photoautotrophic systems attribute the absence of diel uptake variation to nutrient scarcity, such that diel variability in nutrient uptake disappears as nutrients becomes limiting. We tested this prediction in a mesocosm experiment, by exposing benthic algal communities to a range of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus concentrations and recording the rates of uptake during both day and night. We found that higher concentrations of N produced diel variability in uptake, and that the difference between the day and night total mass uptakes approximately equaled N demand for observed primary production as seen in other studies. At lower concentrations of N, uptake rates during the day and night were indistinguishable.

abstract = {Temperature and nutrient availability play key roles in controlling the pathways and rates at which energy and materials move through ecosystems. These factors have also changed dramatically on Earth over the past century as human activities have intensified. Although significant effort has been devoted to understanding the role of temperature and nutrients in isolation, less is known about how these two factors interact to influence ecological processes. Recent advances in ecological stoichiometry and metabolic ecology provide a useful framework for making progress in this area, but conceptual synthesis and review are needed to help catalyze additional research. Here, we examine known and potential interactions between temperature and nutrients from a variety of physiological, community, and ecosystem perspectives. We first review patterns at the level of the individual, focusing on four traits – growth, respiration, body size, and elemental content – that should theoretically govern how temperature and nutrients interact to influence higher levels of biological organization. We next explore the interactive effects of temperature and nutrients on populations, communities, and food webs by synthesizing information related to community size spectra, biomass distributions, and elemental composition. We use metabolic theory to make predictions about how population-level secondary production should respond to interactions between temperature and resource supply, setting up qualitative predictions about the flows of energy and materials through metazoan food webs. Last, we examine how temperature–nutrient interactions influence processes at the whole-ecosystem level, focusing on apparent vs. intrinsic activation energies of ecosystem processes, how to represent temperature–nutrient interactions in ecosystem models, and patterns with respect to nutrient uptake and organic matter decomposition. We conclude that a better understanding of interactions between temperature and nutrients will be critical for developing realistic predictions about ecological responses to multiple, simultaneous drivers of global change, including climate warming and elevated nutrient supply.},
